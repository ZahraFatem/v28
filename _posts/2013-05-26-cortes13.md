title: Multi-Class Classification with Maximum Margin Multiple Kernel
abstract: We present a new algorithm for multi-class classification with multiple
  kernels. Our algorithm is based on a natural notion of the multi-class margin of
  a kernel. We show that larger values of this quantity guarantee the existence of
  an accurate multi-class predictor and also define a family of multiple kernel algorithms
  based on the maximization of the multi-class margin of a kernel (M^3K).  We present
  an extensive theoretical analysis in support of our algorithm, including novel multi-class
  Rademacher complexity margin bounds.  Finally, we also report the results of a series
  of experiments with several data sets, including comparisons where we improve upon
  the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms both in binary and multi-class classification
  with multiple kernels.
