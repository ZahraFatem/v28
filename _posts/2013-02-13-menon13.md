title: A Machine Learning Framework for Programming by Example
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Learning programs is a timely and interesting challenge. In Programming
  by Example (PBE), a system attempts to infer a program from input and output examples
  alone, by searching for a composition of some set of base functions. We show how
  machine learning can be used to speed up this seemingly hopeless search problem,
  by learning weights that relate textual features describing the provided input-output
  examples to plausible sub-components of a program. This generic learning framework
  lets us address problems beyond the scope of earlier PBE systems. Experiments on
  a prototype implementation show that learning improves search and ranking on a variety
  of text processing tasks found on help forums.
