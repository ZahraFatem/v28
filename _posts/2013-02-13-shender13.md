title: Computation-Risk Tradeoffs for Covariance-Thresholded Regression
abstract: We present a family of linear regression estimators that provides a fine-grained
  tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.  The estimators
  are based on hard thresholding of the sample covariance matrix entries together
  with l2-regularizion(ridge regression).  We analyze the predictive risk of this
  family of estimators as a function of the threshold and regularization parameter.  With
  appropriate parameter choices, the estimate is the solution to a sparse, diagonally
  dominant linear system, solvable in near-linear time.  Our analysis shows how the
  risk varies with the sparsity and regularization level, thus establishing a statistical
  estimation setting for which there is an explicit, smooth tradeoff between risk
  and computation.  Simulations are provided to support the theoretical analyses.
