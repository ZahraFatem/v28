title: Infinitesimal Annealing for Training Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines
abstract: 'The semi-supervised support vector machine (S3VM) is a maximum-margin classification
  algorithm based on both labeled and unlabeled data. Training S3VM involves either
  a combinatorial or non-convex optimization problem and thus finding the global optimal
  solution is intractable in practice. It has been demonstrated that a key to successfully
  find a good (local) solution of S3VM is to gradually increase the effect of unlabeled
  data, a la annealing. However, existing algorithms suffer from the trade-off between
  the resolution of annealing steps and the computation cost. In this paper, we go
  beyond this trade-off by proposing a novel training algorithm that efficiently performs
  annealing with an infinitesimal resolution. Through experiments, we demonstrate
  that the proposed infinitesimal annealing algorithm tends to produce better solutions
  with less computation time than existing approaches.  '
