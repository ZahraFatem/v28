title: Convex Relaxations for Learning Bounded-Treewidth Decomposable Graphs
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: We consider the problem of learning the structure of undirected graphical
  models with bounded treewidth, within the maximum likelihood framework. This is
  an NP-hard problem and most approaches consider local search techniques. In this
  paper, we pose it as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is then relaxed
  to a convex optimization problem that involves searching over the forest and hyperforest
  polytopes with special structures. A supergradient method is used to solve the dual
  problem, with a run-time complexity of O(k^3 n^k+2 \log n) for each iteration, where
  n is the number of variables and k is a bound on the treewidth. We compare our approach
  to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets and classical benchmarks, showing
  the gains of the novel convex approach.
