title: Better Rates for Any Adversarial Deterministic MDP
abstract: 'We consider regret minimization in adversarial deterministic Markov  Decision
  Processes (ADMDPs) with bandit feedback. We devise a new  algorithm that pushes
  the state-of-the-art forward in two ways: First,  it attains a regret of O(T^2/3)
  with respect to the best fixed  policy in hindsight, whereas the previous best regret
  bound was  O(T^3/4). Second, the algorithm and its analysis are compatible  with
  any feasible ADMDP graph topology, while all previous approaches  required additional
  restrictions on the graph topology.  '
