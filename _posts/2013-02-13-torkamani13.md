title: Convex Adversarial Collective Classification
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for robustly  performing collective
  classification in the presence of a malicious  adversary that can modify up to a
  fixed number of binary-valued  attributes.  Our method is formulated as a convex
  quadratic program  that guarantees optimal weights against a worst-case adversary
  in  polynomial time.  In addition to increased robustness against active  adversaries,
  this kind of adversarial regularization can also lead to  improved generalization
  even when no adversary is present.  In  experiments on real and simulated data,
  our method consistently  outperforms both non-adversarial and non-relational baselines.
