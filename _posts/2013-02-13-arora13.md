title: A Practical Algorithm for Topic Modeling with Provable Guarantees
abstract: Topic models provide a useful method for dimensionality reduction and exploratory
  data analysis in large text corpora. Most approaches to topic model learning have
  been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient algorithms exist that attempt
  to approximate this objective, but they have no provable guarantees. Recently, algorithms
  have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not
  practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions.
  In this paper we present an algorithm for learning topic models that is both provable
  and practical. The algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations
  while running orders of magnitude faster.
