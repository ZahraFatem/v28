title: Expensive Function Optimization with Stochastic Binary Outcomes
abstract: Real world systems often have parameterized controllers which can be tuned
  to improve performance. Bayesian optimization methods provide for efficient optimization
  of these controllers, so as to reduce the number of required experiments on the
  expensive physical system. In this paper we address Bayesian optimization in the
  setting where performance is only observed through a stochastic binary outcome –
  success or failure of the experiment. Unlike bandit problems, the goal is to maximize
  the system performance after this offline training phase rather than minimize regret
  during training.  In this work we define the stochastic binary optimization problem
  and propose an approach using an adaptation of Gaussian Processes for classification
  that presents a Bayesian optimization framework for this problem.  We propose an
  experiment selection metric for this setting based on expected improvement.  We
  demonstrate the algorithm’s performance on synthetic problems and on a real snake
  robot learning to move over an obstacle.
