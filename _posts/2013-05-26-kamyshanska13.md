title: On autoencoder scoring
abstract: Autoencoders are popular feature learning models because they are conceptually
  simple, easy to train and allow for efficient inference and training. Recent work
  has shown how certain autoencoders can assign an unnormalized “score” to data which
  measures how well the autoencoder can represent the data. Scores are commonly computed
  by using training criteria that relate the autoencoder to a probabilistic model,
  such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine. In this paper we show how an autoencoder
  can assign meaningful scores to data independently of training procedure and without
  reference to any probabilistic model, by interpreting it as a dynamical system.
  We discuss how, and under which conditions, running the dynamical system can be
  viewed as performing gradient descent in an energy function, which in turn allows
  us to derive a score via integration. We also show how one can combine multiple,
  unnormalized scores into a generative classifier.
