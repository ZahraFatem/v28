title: Gated Autoencoders with Tied Input Weights
abstract: The semantic interpretation of images is one of the core applications of
  deep learning. Several techniques have been recently proposed to model the relation
  between two images, with application to pose estimation, action recognition or invariant
  object recognition. Among these techniques, higher-order Boltzmann machines or relational
  autoencoders consider projections of the images on different subspaces and intermediate
  layers act as transformation specific detectors. In this work, we extend the mathematical
  study of (Memisevic, 2012b) to show that it is possible to use a unique projection
  for both images in a way that turns intermediate layers as spectrum encoders of
  transformations. We show that this results in networks that are easier to tune and
  have greater generalization capabilities.
