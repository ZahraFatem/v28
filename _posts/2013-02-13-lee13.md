title: Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation
abstract: Matrix approximation is a common tool in recommendation systems, text mining,
  and computer vision. A prevalent assumption in constructing matrix approximations
  is that the partially observed matrix is of low-rank. We propose a new matrix approximation
  model where we assume instead that the matrix is locally of low-rank, leading to
  a representation of the observed matrix as a weighted sum of low-rank matrices.
  We analyze the accuracy of the proposed local low-rank modeling. Our experiments
  show improvements in prediction accuracy over classical approaches for recommendation
  tasks.
