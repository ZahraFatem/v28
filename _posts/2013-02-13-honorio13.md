title: Two-Sided Exponential Concentration Bounds for Bayes Error Rate and Shannon
  Entropy
abstract: 'We provide a method that approximates the Bayes error rate and the Shannon
  entropy with high probability. The Bayes error rate approximation makes possible
  to build a classifier that polynomially approaches Bayes error rate. The Shannon
  entropy approximation provides provable performance guarantees for learning trees
  and Bayesian networks from continuous variables. Our results rely on some reasonable
  regularity conditions of the unknown probability distributions, and apply to bounded
  as well as unbounded variables.  '
