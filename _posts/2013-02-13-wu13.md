title: Dynamic Covariance Models for Multivariate Financial Time Series
abstract: The accurate prediction of time-changing covariances is an important problem
  in the modeling of multivariate financial data. However, some of the most popular
  models suffer from a) overfitting problems and multiple local optima, b) failure
  to capture shifts in market conditions and c) large computational costs. To address
  these problems we introduce a novel dynamic model for time-changing covariances.
  Over-fitting and local optima are avoided by following a Bayesian approach instead
  of computing point estimates. Changes in market conditions are captured by assuming
  a diffusion process in parameter values, and finally computationally efficient and
  scalable inference is performed using particle filters. Experiments with financial
  data show excellent performance of the proposed method with respect to current standard
  models.
