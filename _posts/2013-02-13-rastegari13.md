title: Predictable Dual-View Hashing
abstract: We propose a Predictable Dual-View Hashing (PDH) algorithm which embeds
  proximity of data samples in the original spaces. We create a cross-view hamming
  space with the ability to compare information from previously incomparable domains
  with a notion of ‘predictability’.   By performing comparative experimental analysis
  on two large datasets, PASCAL-Sentence and SUN-Attribute, we demonstrate the superiority
  of our method to the state-of-the-art dual-view binary code learning algorithms.
