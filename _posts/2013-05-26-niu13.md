title: 'Squared-loss Mutual Information Regularization: A Novel Information-theoretic
  Approach to Semi-supervised Learning'
abstract: 'We propose squared-loss mutual information regularization (SMIR) for multi-class
  probabilistic classification, following the information maximization principle.
  SMIR is convex under mild conditions and thus improves the nonconvexity of mutual
  information regularization. It offers all of the following four abilities to semi-supervised
  algorithms: Analytical solution, out-of-sample/multi-class classification, and probabilistic
  output. Furthermore, novel generalization error bounds are derived. Experiments
  show SMIR compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.'
