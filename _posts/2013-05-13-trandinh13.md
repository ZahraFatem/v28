title: 'A proximal Newton framework for composite minimization: Graph learning without
  Cholesky decompositions and matrix inversions'
abstract: 'We propose an algorithmic framework for convex minimization problems of
  composite functions with two terms:  a self-concordant part and a possibly nonsmooth
  regularization part.  Our method is a new proximal Newton algorithm with local quadratic
  convergence rate. As a specific problem instance, we consider sparse precision matrix
  estimation problems in graph learning. Via a careful dual formulation and a novel
  analytic step-size selection, we instantiate an algorithm within our framework for
  graph learning that avoids Cholesky decompositions and matrix inversions, making
  it attractive for parallel and distributed implementations. '
