title: Learning Hash Functions Using Column Generation
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Fast nearest neighbor searching is becoming  an increasingly important tool
  in solving many  large-scale problems. Recently a number of approaches  to learning
  data-dependent hash functions  have been developed. In this work,  we propose a
  column generation based method  for learning data-dependent hash functions on  the
  basis of proximity comparison information.  Given a set of triplets that encode
  the pairwise  proximity comparison information, our method  learns hash functions
  that preserve the relative  comparison relationships in the data as well as  possible
  within the large-margin learning framework.  The learning procedure is implemented  using
  column generation and hence is named  CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation  procedure,
  the best hash function is selected.  Unlike most other hashing methods, our  method
  generalizes to new data points naturally;  and has a training objective which is
  convex, thus  ensuring that the global optimum can be identified.  Experiments demonstrate
  that the proposed  method learns compact binary codes and that its  retrieval performance
  compares favorably with  state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few  benchmark
  datasets.
