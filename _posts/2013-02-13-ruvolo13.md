title: "{ELLA}: An Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm"
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: The problem of learning multiple consecutive tasks, known as lifelong learning,
  is of great importance to the creation of intelligent, general-purpose, and flexible
  machines.  In this paper, we develop a method for online multi-task learning in
  the lifelong learning setting.  The proposed Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm
  (ELLA) maintains a sparsely shared basis for all task models, transfers knowledge
  from the basis to learn each new task, and refines the basis over time to maximize
  performance across all tasks. We show that ELLA has strong connections to both online
  dictionary learning for sparse coding and state-of-the-art batch multi-task learning
  methods, and provide robust theoretical performance guarantees.  We show empirically
  that ELLA yields nearly identical performance to batch multi-task learning while
  learning tasks sequentially in three orders of magnitude (over 1,000x) less time.
