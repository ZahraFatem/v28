title: Precision-recall space to correct external indices for biclustering
abstract: 'Biclustering is a major tool of data mining in many domains and many algorithms
  have emerged in recent years. All these algorithms aim to obtain coherent biclusters
  and it is crucial to have a reliable procedure for their validation. We point out
  the problem of size bias in biclustering evaluation and show how it can lead to
  wrong conclusions in a comparative study. We present the theoretical corrections
  for all of the most popular measures in order to remove this bias. We introduce
  the corrected precision-recall space that combines the advantages of corrected measures,
  the ease of interpretation and visualization of uncorrected measures. Numerical
  experiments demonstrate the interest of our approach. '
