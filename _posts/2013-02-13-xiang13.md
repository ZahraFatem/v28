title: Efficient Sparse Group Feature Selection via Nonconvex Optimization
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'Sparse feature selection has been demonstrated to be effective in handling
  high-dimensional data. While promising, most of the existing works use convex methods,
  which may be suboptimal in terms of the accuracy of feature selection and parameter
  estimation. In this paper, we expand a nonconvex paradigm to sparse group feature
  selection, which is motivated by applications that require identifying the underlying
  group structure and performing feature selection simultaneously. The main contributions
  of this article are twofold: (1) computationally, we introduce a nonconvex sparse
  group feature selection model and present an efficient optimization algorithm, of
  which the key step is a projection with two coupled constraints; (2) statistically,
  we show that the proposed model can reconstruct the oracle estimator. Therefore,
  consistent feature selection and parameter estimation can be achieved. Numerical
  results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the proposed nonconvex method
  compares favorably against its competitors, thus achieving desired goal of delivering
  high performance.'
