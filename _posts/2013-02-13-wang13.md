title: Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: This paper considers the problem of subspace clustering under noise. Specifically,
  we study the behavior of Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) when either adversarial
  or random noise is added to the unlabelled input data points, which are assumed
  to lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces.  We show that a modified version
  of SSC is \emphprovably effective in correctly identifying the underlying subspaces,
  even with noisy data. This extends theoretical guarantee of this algorithm to the
  practical setting and provides justification to the success of SSC in a class of
  real applications.
