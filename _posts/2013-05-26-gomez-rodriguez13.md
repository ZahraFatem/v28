title: Modeling Information Propagation with Survival Theory
abstract: Networks provide a ‘skeleton’ for the spread of contagions, like, information,
  ideas, behaviors and diseases. Many times networks over which contagions diffuse
  are unobserved and need to be inferred. Here we apply survival theory to develop
  general additive and multiplicative risk models under which the network inference
  problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting their convexity. Our additive risk
  model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models
  are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows
  for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk
  of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider
  only positive risk increments. We evaluate the performance of our network inference
  algorithms on large synthetic and real cascade datasets, and show that our models
  are able to predict the length and duration of cascades in real data.
