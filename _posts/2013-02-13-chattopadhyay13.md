title: Joint Transfer and Batch-mode Active Learning
abstract: Active learning and transfer learning are two different methodologies that
  address the common  problem of insufficient labels. Transfer learning addresses
  this problem by using the knowledge gained from a related and already labeled data
  source, whereas active learning focuses on selecting a small set of informative
  samples  for manual annotation. Recently, there has been much interest in developing
  frameworks that combine both transfer and active learning  methodologies. A few
  such frameworks reported in literature perform transfer and active learning in two
  separate stages. In this work, we present an integrated framework that performs
  transfer and active learning simultaneously by solving a  single convex optimization
  problem. The proposed framework computes the weights of source domain data and selects
  the samples from the target domain data simultaneously, by minimizing a common objective
  of reducing distribution difference between the data set consisting of reweighted
  source and the queried target domain data and the set of unlabeled target domain
  data. Comprehensive experiments on three real world data sets demonstrate that the
  proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 5% to  10% over the existing
  two-stage approach
