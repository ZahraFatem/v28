title: 'Thurstonian Boltzmann Machines: Learning from Multiple Inequalities'
abstract: 'We introduce Thurstonian Boltzmann Machines (TBM), a unified architecture
  that can naturally incorporate a wide range of data inputs at the same time. Our
  motivation rests in the Thurstonian view that many discrete data types can be considered
  as being generated from a subset of underlying latent continuous variables, and
  in the observation that each realisation of a discrete type imposes certain inequalities
  on those variables. Thus learning and inference in TBM reduce to making sense of
  a set of inequalities. Our proposed TBM naturally supports the following types:
  Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary, categorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in)-complete
  rank with and without ties. We demonstrate the versatility and capacity of the proposed
  model on three applications of very different natures; namely handwritten digit
  recognition, collaborative filtering and complex social survey analysis.'
