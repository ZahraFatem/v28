title: Fast Semidifferential-based Submodular Function Optimization
abstract: We present a practical and powerful new framework for both unconstrained
  and constrained submodular function optimization based on discrete semidifferentials
  (sub- and super-differentials). The resulting algorithms, which repeatedly compute
  and then efficiently optimize submodular semigradients, offer new and generalize
  many old methods for submodular optimization.  Our approach, moreover, takes steps
  towards providing a unifying paradigm applicable to both submodular minimization
  and maximization, problems that historically have been treated quite distinctly.
  The practicality of our algorithms is important since interest in submodularity,
  owing to its natural and wide applicability, has recently been in ascendance within
  machine learning.  We analyze theoretical properties of our algorithms for minimization
  and maximization, and show that many state-of-the-art maximization algorithms are
  special cases. Lastly, we complement our theoretical analyses with supporting empirical
  experiments.
