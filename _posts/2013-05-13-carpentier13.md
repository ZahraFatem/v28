title: Toward Optimal Stratification for Stratified Monte-Carlo Integration
abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo
  integration of a function, given a finite number of function evaluations perturbed
  by noise. Here we address the problem of adapting simultaneously the number of samples
  into each stratum and the stratification itself. We show a tradeoff in the size
  of the partitioning. On the one hand it is important to refine the partition in
  areas where the observation noise or the function are heterogeneous in order to
  reduce this variability. But on the other hand, a too refined stratification makes
  it harder to assign the samples according to a near-optimal (oracle) allocation
  strategy. In this paper we provide an algorithm \em Monte-Carlo Upper-Lower Confidence
  Bound that selects online, among a large class of partitions, the partition that
  provides a near-optimal trade-off, and allocates the samples almost optimally on
  this partition.
