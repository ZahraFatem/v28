title: Learning the beta-Divergence in Tweedie Compound Poisson Matrix Factorization
  Models
abstract: 'In this study, we derive algorithms for estimating mixed β-divergences.
  Such cost functions are useful for Nonnegative Matrix and Tensor Factorization models
  with a compound Poisson observation model. Compound Poisson is a particular Tweedie
  model, an important special case of exponential dispersion models characterized
  by the fact that the variance is proportional to a power function of the mean. There
  are several well known matrix and tensor factorization algorithms that minimize
  the β-divergence; these estimate the mean parameter. The probabilistic interpretation
  gives us more flexibility and robustness by providing us additional tunable parameters
  such as power and dispersion. Estimation of the power parameter is useful for choosing
  a suitable divergence and estimation of dispersion is useful for data driven regularization
  and weighting in collective/coupled factorization of heterogeneous datasets. We
  present three inference algorithms for both estimating the factors and the additional
  parameters of the compound Poisson distribution. The methods are evaluated on two
  applications: modeling symbolic representations for polyphonic music and lyric prediction
  from audio features. Our conclusion is that the compound poisson based factorization
  models can be useful for sparse positive data.'
