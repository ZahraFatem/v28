title: Fastfood - Computing Hilbert Space Expansions in loglinear time
abstract: 'Fast nonlinear function classes are crucial for nonparametric estimation,
  such as in kernel methods. This paper proposes an improvement to random kitchen
  sinks that offers significantly faster computation in log-linear time without sacrificing
  accuracy. Furthermore, we show how one may adjust the regularization properties
  of the kernel simply by changing the spectral distribution of the projection matrix.
  We provide experimental results which show that even for for moderately small problems
  we already achieve two orders of magnitude faster computation and three orders of
  magnitude lower memory footprint.  '
