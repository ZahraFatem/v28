title: Structure Discovery in Nonparametric Regression through Compositional Kernel
  Search
abstract: Despite its importance, choosing the structural form of the kernel in nonparametric
  regression remains a black art. We define a space of kernel structures which are
  built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels.
  We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the
  scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions
  into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series
  datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel
  combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.
