title: Learning Triggering Kernels for Multi-dimensional Hawkes Processes
abstract: 'How does the activity of one person affect that of another person? Does
  the strength of influence remain periodic or decay exponentially over time? In this
  paper, we study these critical questions in social network analysis quantitatively
  under the framework of multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. In particular, we focus
  on the nonparametric learning of the  triggering kernels, and propose an algorithm
  \sf MMEL that combines the idea of decoupling the parameters through constructing
  a tight upper-bound of the objective function and application of Euler-Lagrange
  equations for optimization in infinite dimensional functional space.    We show
  that the proposed method performs significantly better than alternatives in experiments
  on both synthetic and real world datasets.  '
