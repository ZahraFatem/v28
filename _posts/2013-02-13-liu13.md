title: Guaranteed Sparse Recovery under Linear Transformation
abstract: 'We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a  measurement
  matrix Φ∈\mathbbR^n\times p and a noisy  observation vector c∈\mathbbR^n constructed
  from c =  Φθ^* + εwhere ε∈\mathbbR^n is the  noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d.
  centered sub-Gaussian  distribution, how to recover the signal θ^* if Dθ^* is  sparse
  \rca under a linear transformation D∈\mathbbR^m\times  p? One natural method using
  convex optimization is to solve the  following problem: $\min_θ 1\over 2\|Φθ- c\|^2
  +  λ\|Dθ\|_1. This paper provides an upper bound of the  estimate error and shows
  the consistency property of this method by  assuming that the design matrix Φis
  a Gaussian random matrix.  Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the
  condition  number of D is bounded and the measurement number n≥Ω(s\log(p)) where
  s is the sparsity number, then the true  solution can be recovered with high probability;
  and 2) in the noisy  case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement  increases
  faster than s\log(p), that is, s\log(p)=o(n), the  estimate error converges to zero
  with probability 1 when p and s  go to infinity. Our results are consistent with
  those for the  special case D=\boldI_p\times p (equivalently LASSO) and  improve
  the existing analysis. The condition number of D plays a  critical role in our analysis.
  We consider the condition numbers in  two cases including the fused LASSO and the
  random graph: the  condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant,  while
  the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with  high probability
  if m\over p (i.e., #\textedge\over  #\textvertex$) is larger than a certain constant.
  Numerical  simulations are consistent with our theoretical results.'
