title: Gaussian Process Kernels for Pattern Discovery and Extrapolation
abstract: Gaussian processes are rich distributions over functions, which provide
  a Bayesian nonparametric approach to smoothing and interpolation.  We introduce
  simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover
  patterns and enable extrapolation.  These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral
  density – the Fourier transform of a kernel – with a Gaussian mixture.  The proposed
  kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference
  remains simple and analytic.  We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering
  patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well
  as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data.  We also show that it is possible
  to reconstruct several popular standard covariances within our framework.
