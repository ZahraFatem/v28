title: The Bigraphical Lasso
abstract: The i.i.d. assumption in machine learning is endemic, but often flawed.
  Complex data sets exhibit partial correlations between both instances and features.
  A model specifying both types of correlation can have a number of parameters that
  scales quadratically with the number of features and data points. We introduce the
  bigraphical lasso, an estimator for precision matrices of matrix-normals based on
  the Cartesian product of graphs. A prominent product in spectral graph theory, this
  structure has appealing properties for regression, enhanced sparsity and interpretability.
  To deal with the parameter explosion we introduce L1 penalties and fit the model
  through a flip-flop algorithm that results in a linear number of lasso regressions.
