title: The Sample-Complexity of General Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'We study the sample-complexity of reinforcement learning in a general setting
  without  assuming ergodicity or finiteness of the environment. Instead, we define
  a topology  on the space of environments and show that  if an environment class
  is compact with respect to this topology then finite sample-complexity bounds are
  possible and give an  algorithm achieving these bounds. We also  show the existence
  of environment classes  that are non-compact where finite sample-complexity bounds
  are not achievable. A  lower bound is presented that matches the  upper bound except
  for logarithmic factors.  '
