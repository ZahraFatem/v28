title: Estimating Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing
abstract: In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity \|x\|_0 of the unknown
  signal x∈\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically
  unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of  CS depend on knowing
  \|x\|_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second
  practical concern is that \|x\|_0 is a highly unstable function of x. In particular,
  for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value \|x\|_0=p is not
  a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose
  to estimate a stable measure of sparsity s(x):=\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2, which is a sharp
  lower bound on \|x\|_0. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear
  measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little
  computation. A confidence interval for s(x) is  provided, and its width is shown
  to have no dependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally
  to the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be estimated
  with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of randomized measurements
  is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished by proving that the minimax
  risk for estimating s(x) with deterministic measurements is large when n≪p.
