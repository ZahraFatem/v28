title: An Optimal Policy for Target Localization with Application to Electron Microscopy
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: This paper considers the task of finding a target location by making a limited
  number of sequential observations.  Each observation results from evaluating an
  imperfect classifier of a chosen cost and accuracy on an interval of chosen length
  and position.  Within a Bayesian framework, we study the problem of minimizing an
  objective that combines the entropy of the posterior distribution with the cost
  of the questions asked.  In this problem, we show that the one-step lookahead policy
  is Bayes-optimal for any arbitrary time horizon.  Moreover, this one-step lookahead
  policy is easy to compute and implement. We then use this policy in the context
  of localizing mitochondria in electron microscope images, and experimentally show
  that significant speed ups in acquisition can be gained, while maintaining near
  equal image quality at target locations, when compared to current policies.
