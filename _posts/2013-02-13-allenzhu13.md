title: A Local Algorithm for Finding Well-Connected Clusters
abstract: 'Motivated by applications of large-scale graph clustering, we study random-walk-based
  LOCAL algorithms whose running times depend only on the size of the output cluster,
  rather than the entire graph. In particular, we develop a method with better theoretical
  guarantee compared to all previous work, both in terms of the clustering accuracy
  and the conductance of the output set. We also prove that our analysis is tight,
  and perform empirical evaluation to support our theory on both synthetic and real
  data.    More specifically, our method outperforms prior work when the cluster is
  WELL-CONNECTED. In fact, the better it is well-connected inside, the more significant
  improvement we can obtain. Our results shed light on why in practice some random-walk-based
  algorithms perform better than its previous theory, and help guide future research
  about local clustering.  '
