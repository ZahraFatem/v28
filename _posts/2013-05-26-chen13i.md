title: Dependent Normalized Random Measures
abstract: In this paper we propose two constructions of dependent normalized random
  measures, a class of nonparametric priors over dependent probability measures. Our
  constructions, which we call mixed normalized random measures (MNRM) and thinned
  normalized random measures (TNRM), involve (respectively) weighting and thinning
  parts of a shared underlying Poisson process before combining them together. We
  show that both MNRM and TNRM are marginally normalized random measures, resulting
  in well understood theoretical properties. We develop marginal and slice samplers
  for both models, the latter necessary for inference in TNRM. In time-varying topic
  modelling experiments, both models exhibit superior performance over related dependent
  models such as the hierarchical Dirichlet process and the spatial normalized Gamma
  process.
