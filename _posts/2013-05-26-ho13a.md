title: On A Nonlinear Generalization of Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning
abstract: Existing dictionary learning algorithms are based on the  assumption that
  the data are vectors in an Euclidean vector  space, and the dictionary is learned
  from the training data using the vector space structure and its Euclidean metric.
  However, in many applications, features and data often originated from a Riemannian
  manifold that does not support a global linear (vector space) structure.  Furthermore,
  the extrinsic viewpoint of existing dictionary learning algorithms becomes inappropriate
  for modeling and incorporating the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that is potentially
  important and critical to the application. This paper proposes a novel framework
  for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and
  it shows that  the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be
  considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here.
  We show that both the dictionary and sparse coding can  be effectively computed
  for several important classes of Riemannian manifolds, and we validate the proposed
  method using two well-known classification problems in computer vision and medical
  imaging analysis.
