title: Modelling Sparse Dynamical Systems with Compressed Predictive State Representations
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Efficiently learning accurate models of dynamical systems is of central
  importance for developing rational agents that can succeed in a wide range of challenging
  domains. The difficulty of this learning problem is particularly acute in settings
  with large observation spaces and partial observability. We present a new algorithm,
  called Compressed Predictive State Representation (CPSR), for learning models of
  high-dimensional partially observable uncontrolled dynamical systems from small
  sample sets. The algorithm, which extends previous work on Predictive State Representations,
  exploits a particular sparse structure present in many domains. This sparse structure
  is used to compress information during learning, allowing for an increase in both
  the efficiency and predictive power. The compression technique also relieves the
  burden of domain specific feature selection and allows for domains with extremely
  large discrete observation spaces to be efficiently modelled. We present empirical
  results showing that the algorithm is able to build accurate models more efficiently
  than its uncompressed counterparts, and provide theoretical results on the accuracy
  of the learned compressed model.
