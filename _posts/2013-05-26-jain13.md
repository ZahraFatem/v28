title: Differentially Private Learning with Kernels
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of differentially private learning
  where access to the training features is through a kernel function only. Existing
  work on this problem is restricted to translation invariant kernels only, where
  (approximate) training features are available explicitly.  In fact, for general
  class of kernel functions and in general setting of releasing different private
  predictor (\w^*), the problem is impossible to solve \citeCMS11. In this work, we
  relax the problem setting into three different easier but practical settings. In
  our first problem setting, we consider an interactive model where the user sends
  its test set to a trusted learner who sends back differentially private predictions
  over the test points. This setting is prevalent in modern online systems like search
  engines, ad engines etc. In the second model, the learner sends back a differentially
  private version of the optimal parameter vector \w^* but requires access to a small
  subset of unlabeled test set beforehand. This also is a practical setting that involves
  two parties interacting through trusted third party. Our third model is similar
  to the traditional model, where learner is oblivious to the test set and needs to
  send a differentially private version of \w^*, but the kernels are restricted to
  efficiently computable functions over low-dimensional vector spaces. For each of
  the models, we derive differentially private learning algorithms with provable “utlity”
  or error bounds. Moreover, we  show that our methods can also be applied to the
  traditional setting of \cite Rubinstein09, CMS11. Here, our sample complexity bounds
  have only O(d^1/3) dependence on the dimensionality d while existing methods require
  O(d^1/2) samples to achieve same generalization error.
