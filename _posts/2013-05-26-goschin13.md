title: The Cross-Entropy Method Optimizes for Quantiles
abstract: Cross-entropy optimization (CE) has proven to be a powerful tool for search
  in control environments. In the basic scheme, a distribution over proposed solutions
  is repeatedly adapted by evaluating a sample of solutions and refocusing the distribution
  on a percentage of those with the highest scores.  We show that, in the kind of
  noisy evaluation environments that are common in decision-making domains, this percentage-based
  refocusing does not optimize the expected utility of solutions, but instead a quantile
  metric. We provide a variant of CE (Proportional CE) that effectively optimizes
  the expected value. We show using variants of established noisy environments that
  Proportional CE can be used in place of CE and can improve solution quality.
