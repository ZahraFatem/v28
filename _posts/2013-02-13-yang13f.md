title: Quantile Regression for Large-scale Applications
abstract: Quantile regression is a method to estimate the quantiles of the   conditional
  distribution of a response variable, and as such it permits a   much more accurate
  portrayal of the relationship between the response variable   and observed covariates
  than methods such as Least-squares or   Least Absolute Deviations regression.  It
  can be expressed as a linear program,   and   interior-point methods can be used
  to find a solution for  moderately large problems.  Dealing with very large problems,
  \emphe.g., involving data up to and   beyond the terabyte regime, remains a challenge.  Here,
  we present a randomized algorithm that runs in time that is nearly   linear in the
  size of the input and that, with constant probability,   computes a (1+Îµ) approximate
  solution to an arbitrary quantile   regression problem.  Our algorithm computes
  a low-distortion subspace-preserving  embedding with respect to the loss function
  of quantile regression.  Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm
  is competitive with   the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems,
  and that   it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and    applied to
  terabyte-sized problems.
