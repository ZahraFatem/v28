title: Large-Scale Bandit Problems and KWIK Learning
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: We show that parametric multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems with large state
  and action spaces can be algorithmically reduced to the supervised learning model
  known as Knows What It Knows or KWIK learning. We give matching impossibility results
  showing that the KWIK learnability requirement cannot be replaced by weaker supervised
  learning assumptions. We provide such results in both the standard parametric MAB
  setting, as well as for a new model in which the action space is finite but growing
  with time.
