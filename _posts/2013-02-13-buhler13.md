title: Constrained fractional set programs and their  application in local clustering
  and community detection
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: The (constrained) minimization of a ratio of set functions is a problem
  frequently occurring in clustering and community detection. As these optimization
  problems are typically NP-hard, one uses convex or spectral relaxations in practice.
  While these relaxations can be solved globally optimally, they are often too loose
  and thus lead to results far away from the optimum. In this paper we show that every
  constrained minimization problem of a ratio of non-negative set functions allows
  a tight relaxation into an unconstrained continuous optimization problem. This result
  leads to a flexible framework for solving constrained problems in network analysis.
  While a globally optimal solution for the resulting non-convex problem cannot be
  guaranteed, we outperform the loose convex or spectral relaxations by a large margin
  on constrained local clustering problems.
