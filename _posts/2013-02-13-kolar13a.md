title: Markov Network Estimation From Multi-attribute Data
abstract: Many real world network problems often concern multivariate nodal attributes
  such as image, textual, and multi-view feature vectors on nodes, rather than simple
  univariate nodal attributes. The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian
  graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither
  can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper,
  we propose a new principled framework for estimating multi-attribute graphs. Instead
  of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates
  the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features.  Computationally,
  we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure.
  Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph
  recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under
  various conditions.
