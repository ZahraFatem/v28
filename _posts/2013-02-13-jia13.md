title: On Compact Codes for Spatially Pooled Features
abstract: Feature encoding with an overcomplete dictionary has demonstrated good performance
  in many applications, especially computer vision. In this paper we analyze the classification
  accuracy with respect to dictionary size by linking the encoding stage to kernel
  methods and \nystrom sampling, and obtain useful bounds on accuracy as a function
  of size. The \nystrom method also inspires us to revisit dictionary learning from
  local patches, and we propose to learn the dictionary in an end-to-end fashion taking
  into account pooling, a common computational layer in vision. We validate our contribution
  by showing how the derived bounds are able to explain the observed behavior of multiple
  datasets, and show that the pooling aware method efficiently reduces the dictionary
  size by a factor of two for a given accuracy.
