title: Maximum Variance Correction with Application to A* Search
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: In this paper we introduce Maximum Variance Correction (MVC), which finds
  large-scale feasible solutions to Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) by post-processing
  embeddings from any manifold learning algorithm. It increases the scale of MVU embeddings
  by several orders of magnitude and is naturally parallel. This unprecedented scalability
  opens up new avenues of applications for manifold learning, in particular the use
  of MVU embeddings as effective heuristics to speed-up A* search (Rayner et al. 2011).   We
  demonstrate that MVC embeddings lead to un-matched reductions in search time across
  several non-trivial A* benchmark search problems and bridge the gap between the
  manifold learning literature and one of its most promising high impact applications.
