title: Sparse Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach for sparse uncorrelated linear
  discriminant analysis (ULDA). Our proposal is based on characterization of all solutions
  of the generalized ULDA. We incorporate sparsity into the ULDA transformation by
  seeking the solution with minimum \ell_1-norm from all minimum dimension solutions
  of the generalized ULDA. The problem is then formulated as a \ell_1-minimization
  problem and is solved by accelerated linearized Bregman method. Experiments on high-dimensional
  gene expression data demonstrate that our approach not only computes extremely sparse
  solutions but also performs well in classification. Experimental results also show
  that our approach can help for data visualization in low-dimensional space.
