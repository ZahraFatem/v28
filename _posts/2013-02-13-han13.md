title: Principal Component Analysis on non-Gaussian Dependent Data
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: "In this paper, we analyze the performance of a semiparametric principal
  component analysis named Copula Component Analysis (COCA) (Han & Liu, 2012) when
  the data are dependent. The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified
  marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian.
  We study the scenario where the observations are drawn from non-i.i.d. processes
  (m-dependency or a more general phi\x1E-mixing case). We show that COCA can allow
  weak dependence. In particular, we provide the generalization bounds of convergence
  for both support recovery and parameter estimation of COCA for the dependent data.
  We provide explicit sufficient conditions on the degree of dependence, under which
  the parametric rate can be maintained. To our knowledge, this is the first work
  analyzing the theoretical performance of PCA for the dependent data in high dimensional
  settings. Our results strictly generalize the analysis in Han & Liu (2012) and the
  techniques we used have the separate interest for analyzing a variety of other multivariate
  statistical methods."
