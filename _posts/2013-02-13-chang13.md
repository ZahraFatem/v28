title: Canonical Correlation Analysis based on Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
  and Centered Kernel Target Alignment
abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a well established technique for
  identifying linear relationships among two variable sets.  Kernel CCA (KCCA) is
  the most notable nonlinear extension but it lacks interpretability and robustness
  against irrelevant features.  The aim of this article is to introduce two nonlinear
  CCA extensions that rely on the recently proposed Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion
  and the centered kernel target alignment.  These extensions determine linear projections
  that provide maximally dependent projected data pairs.  The paper demonstrates that
  the use of linear projections allows removing irrelevant features, whilst extracting
  combinations of strongly associated features.  This is exemplified through a simulation
  and the analysis of recorded data that are available in the literature.
