title: Dynamic Probabilistic Models for Latent Feature Propagation in Social Networks
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: Current Bayesian models for dynamic social network data have focused on
  modelling the influence of evolving unobserved structure on observed social interactions.
  However, an understanding of how observed social relationships from the past affect
  future unobserved structure in the network has been neglected.  In this paper, we
  introduce a new probabilistic model for capturing this phenomenon, which we call
  latent feature propagation, in social networks.  We demonstrate our modelâ€™s capability
  for inferring such latent structure in varying types of social network datasets,
  and experimental studies show this structure achieves higher predictive performance
  on link prediction and forecasting tasks.
