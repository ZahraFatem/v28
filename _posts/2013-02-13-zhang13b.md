title: 'Covariate Shift in Hilbert Space: A Solution via Sorrogate Kernels'
abstract: "Covariate shift is a unconventional learning scenario in which training
  and testing data have different distributions. A general principle to solve the
  problem is to make the training data distribution similar to the test one, such
  that classifiers computed on the former generalizes well to the latter. Current
  approaches typically target on the sample distribution in the input space, however,
  for kernel-based learning methods, the algorithm performance depends directly on
  the geometry of the kernel-induced feature space. Motivated by this, we propose
  to match data distributions in the Hilbert space, which, given a pre-defined empirical
  kernel map, can be formulated as aligning kernel matrices across domains. In particular,
  to evaluate similarity of kernel matrices defined on arbitrarily different samples,
  the novel concept of surrogate kernel is introduced based on the Mercer\x1As theorem.
  Our approach caters the model adaptation specifically to kernel-based learning mechanism,
  and demonstrates promising results on several real-world applications."
