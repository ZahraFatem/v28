title: Spectral Compressed Sensing via Structured Matrix Completion
abstract: 'The paper studies the problem of recovering a spectrally sparse object
  from a small number of time domain samples. Specifically, the object of interest
  with ambient dimension n is assumed to be a mixture of r complex multi-dimensional
  sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk.
  Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the \em basis mismatch issue
  when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this
  problem,  we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion
  (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by converting
  the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts
  recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC
  allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of \mathcalO(r\log^2
  n). We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold
  Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to
  the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness
  of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further
  demonstrated by numerical experiments.  '
