title: Spectral Experts for Estimating Mixtures of Linear Regressions
abstract: 'Discriminative latent-variable models are typically learned using EM or
  gradient-based optimization, which suffer from local optima.  In this paper, we
  develop a new computationally efficient and provably consistent estimator for the
  mixture of linear regressions, a simple instance of discriminative latent-variable
  models.  Our approach relies on a low-rank linear regression to recover a symmetric
  tensor, which can be factorized into the parameters using the tensor power method.  We
  prove rates of convergence for our estimator and provide an empirical evaluation
  illustrating its strengths relative to local optimization (EM).  '
