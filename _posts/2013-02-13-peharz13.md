title: The Most Generative Maximum Margin Bayesian Networks
abstract: Although discriminative learning in graphical models generally improves
  classification results, the generative semantics of the model are compromised.  In
  this paper, we introduce a novel approach of hybrid generative-discriminative learning
  for Bayesian networks.  We use an SVM-type large margin formulation for discriminative
  training, introducing a likelihood-weighted \ell^1-norm for the SVM-norm-penalization.  This
  simultaneously optimizes the data likelihood and therefore partly maintains the
  generative character of the model.  For many network structures, our method can
  be formulated as a convex problem, guaranteeing a globally optimal solution.  In
  terms of classification, the resulting models outperform state-of-the art generative
  and discriminative learning methods for Bayesian networks, and are comparable with
  linear and kernelized SVMs.  Furthermore, the models achieve likelihoods close to
  the maximum likelihood solution and show robust behavior in classification experiments
  with missing features.
