title: 'Entropic Affinities: Properties and Efficient Numerical Computation'
abstract: Gaussian affinities are commonly used in graph-based methods such as spectral
  clustering or nonlinear embedding. Hinton and Roweis (2003) introduced a way to
  set the scale individually for each point so that it has a distribution over neighbors
  with a desired perplexity, or effective number of neighbors. This gives very good
  affinities that adapt locally to the data but are harder to compute. We study the
  mathematical properties of these “entropic affinities” and show that they implicitly
  define a continuously differentiable function in the input space and give bounds
  for it. We then devise a fast algorithm to compute the widths and affinities, based
  on robustified, quickly convergent root-finding methods combined with a tree- or
  density-based initialization scheme that exploits the slowly-varying behavior of
  this function. This algorithm is nearly optimal and much more accurate and fast
  than the existing bisection-based approach, particularly with large datasets, as
  we show with image and text data.
