title: Scaling the Indian Buffet Process via Submodular Maximization
abstract: 'Inference for latent feature models is inherently difficult as the inference
  space grows exponentially with the size of the input data and number of latent features.
  In this work, we use Kurihara & Wellings (2008)â€™s maximization-expectation framework
  to perform approximate MAP inference for linear-Gaussian latent feature models with
  an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior. This formulation yields a submodular function
  of the features that corresponds to a lower bound on the model evidence. By adding
  a constant to this function, we obtain a nonnegative submodular function that can
  be maximized via a greedy algorithm that obtains at least a 1/3-approximation to
  the optimal solution. Our inference method scales linearly with the size of the
  input data, and we show the efficacy of our method on the largest datasets currently
  analyzed using an IBP model. '
