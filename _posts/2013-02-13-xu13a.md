title: Fast Max-Margin Matrix Factorization with Data Augmentation
abstract: Existing max-margin matrix factorization (M3F) methods either are computationally
  inefficient or need a model selection procedure to determine the number of latent
  factors. In this paper we present a probabilistic M3F model that admits a highly
  efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm through data augmentation. We further extend
  our approach to incorporate Bayesian nonparametrics and build accordingly a truncation-free
  nonparametric M3F model where the number of latent factors is literally unbounded
  and inferred from data. Empirical studies on two large real-world data sets verify
  the efficacy of our proposed methods.
