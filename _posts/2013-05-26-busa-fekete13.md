title: Top-k Selection based on Adaptive Sampling of Noisy Preferences
abstract: We consider the problem of reliably selecting an optimal subset of fixed
  size from a given set of choice alternatives, based on noisy information about the
  quality of these alternatives. Problems of similar kind have been tackled by means
  of adaptive sampling schemes called racing algorithms. However, in contrast to existing
  approaches, we do not assume that each alternative is characterized by a real-valued
  random variable, and that samples are taken from the corresponding distributions.
  Instead, we only assume that alternatives can be compared in terms of pairwise preferences.
  We propose and formally analyze a general preference-based racing algorithm that
  we instantiate with three specific ranking procedures and corresponding sampling
  schemes. Experiments with real and synthetic data are presented to show the efficiency
  of our approach.
