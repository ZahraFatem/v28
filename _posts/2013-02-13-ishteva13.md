title: Unfolding Latent Tree Structures using 4th Order Tensors
abstract: Discovering the latent structure from many observed variables is an important
  yet challenging learning task. Existing approaches for discovering latent structures
  often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. In this paper, we
  propose a quartet based approach which is agnostic to this number. The key contribution
  is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution
  of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a nuclear norm based test
  for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in
  a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under mild
  conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially
  with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares
  favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it also discovers meaningful
  groupings of variables, and produces a model that fits the data better.
