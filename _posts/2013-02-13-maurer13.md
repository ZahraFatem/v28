title: Sparse coding for multitask and transfer learning
abstract: We investigate the use of sparse coding and dictionary learning in the context
  of multitask and transfer learning. The central assumption of our learning method
  is that the tasks parameters are well approximated by sparse linear combinations
  of the atoms of a dictionary on a high or infinite dimensional space. This assumption,
  together with the large quantity of available data in the multitask and transfer
  learning settings, allows a principled choice of the dictionary. We provide bounds
  on the generalization error of this approach, for both settings. Numerical experiments
  on one synthetic and two real datasets show the advantage of our method over single
  task learning, a previous method based on orthogonal and dense representation of
  the tasks and a related method learning task grouping.
