title: 'Noisy and Missing Data Regression: Distribution-Oblivious Support Recovery'
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Many models for sparse regression typically assume that the covariates are
  known completely, and without noise. Particularly in high-dimensional applications,
  this is often not the case. Worse yet, even estimating statistics of the noise (the
  noise covariance) can be a central challenge. In this paper we develop a simple
  variant of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for precisely this setting. We show
  that without knowledge of the noise covariance, our algorithm recovers the support,
  and we provide matching lower bounds that show that our algorithm performs at the
  minimax optimal rate. While simple, this is the first algorithm that (provably)
  recovers support in a noise-distribution-oblivious manner. When knowledge of the
  noise-covariance is available, our algorithm matches the best-known \ell^2-recovery
  bounds available. We show that these too are min-max optimal. Along the way, we
  also obtain improved performance guarantees for OMP for the standard sparse regression
  problem with Gaussian noise.
