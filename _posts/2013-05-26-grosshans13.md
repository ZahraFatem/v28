title: Bayesian Games for Adversarial Regression Problems
abstract: We study regression problems in which an adversary can exercise some control
  over the data generation process. Learner and adversary have conflicting but not
  necessarily perfectly antagonistic objectives. We study the case in which the learner
  is not fully informed about the adversary’s objective; instead, any knowledge of
  the learner about parameters of the adversary’s goal may be reflected in a Bayesian
  prior. We model this problem as a Bayesian game, and characterize conditions under
  which a unique Bayesian equilibrium point exists. We experimentally compare the
  Bayesian equilibrium strategy to the Nash equilibrium strategy, the minimax strategy,
  and regular linear regression.
