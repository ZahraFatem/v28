title: Analogy-preserving Semantic Embedding for Visual Object Categorization
abstract: 'In multi-class categorization tasks, knowledge about the classes’ semantic
  relationships can provide valuable information beyond the class labels themselves.  However,
  existing techniques focus on preserving the semantic distances between classes (e.g.,
  according to a given object taxonomy for visual recognition), limiting the influence
  to pairwise structures.  We propose to model \emphanalogies that reflect the relationships
  between multiple pairs of classes simultaneously, in the form “p is to q, as r is
  to s"".  We translate semantic analogies into higher-order geometric constraints
  called \emphanalogical parallelograms, and use them in a novel convex regularizer
  for a discriminatively learned label embedding.   Furthermore, we show how to discover
  analogies from attribute-based class descriptions, and how to prioritize those likely
  to reduce inter-class confusion.  Evaluating our Analogy-preserving Semantic Embedding
  (ASE) on two visual recognition datasets, we demonstrate clear improvements over
  existing approaches, both in terms of recognition accuracy and analogy completion.  '
