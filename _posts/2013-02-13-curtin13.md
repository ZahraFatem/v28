title: Tree-Independent Dual-Tree Algorithms
abstract: 'Dual-tree algorithms are a widely used class of branch-and-bound algorithms.  Unfortunately,
  developing dual-tree algorithms for use with different trees and problems is often
  complex and burdensome.  We introduce a four-part logical split: the tree, the traversal,
  the point-to-point base case, and the pruning rule.  We provide a meta-algorithm
  which allows development of dual-tree algorithms in a tree-independent manner and
  easy extension to entirely new types of trees.  Representations are provided  for
  five common algorithms; for k-nearest neighbor search, this leads to a novel, tighter
  pruning bound. The meta-algorithm also allows  straightforward extensions to massively
  parallel settings.'
