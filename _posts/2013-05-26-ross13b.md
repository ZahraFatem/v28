title: Learning Policies for Contextual Submodular Prediction
abstract: 'Many prediction domains, such as ad placement, recommendation, trajectory
  prediction, and document summarization, require predicting a set or list of options.
  Such lists are often evaluated using submodular reward functions that measure both
  quality and diversity. We propose a simple, efficient, and provably near-optimal
  approach to optimizing such prediction problems based on no-regret learning. Our
  method leverages a surprising result from online submodular optimization: a single
  no-regret online learner can compete with an optimal sequence of predictions. Compared
  to previous work, which either learn a sequence of classifiers or rely on stronger
  assumptions such as realizability, we ensure both data-efficiency as well as performance
  guarantees in the fully agnostic setting. Experiments validate the efficiency and
  applicability of the approach on a wide range of problems including manipulator
  trajectory optimization, news recommendation and document summarization.'
