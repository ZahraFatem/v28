title: Domain Adaptation under Target and Conditional Shift
abstract: 'Let X denote the feature and Y the target. We consider domain adaptation
  under three possible scenarios: (1) the marginal P_Y changes, while the conditional
  P_X|Y stays the same (\it target shift), (2) the marginal P_Y is fixed, while the
  conditional P_X|Y changes with certain constraints (\it conditional shift), and
  (3) the marginal P_Y changes, and the conditional P_X|Y changes with constraints
  (\it generalized target shift). Using background knowledge, causal interpretations
  allow us to determine the correct situation for a problem at hand. We exploit importance
  reweighting or sample transformation to find the learning machine that works well
  on test data, and propose to estimate the weights or transformations by \it reweighting
  or transforming training data to reproduce the covariate distribution on the test
  domain. Thanks to kernel embedding of conditional as well as marginal distributions,
  the proposed approaches avoid distribution estimation, and are applicable for high-dimensional
  problems. Numerical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed framework.'
