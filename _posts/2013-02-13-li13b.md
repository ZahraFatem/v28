title: Fixed-Point Model For Structured Labeling
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a simple but effective  solution to the structured
  labeling problem:  a fixed-point model. Recently, layered  models with sequential
  classifiers/regressors  have gained an increasing amount of interests  for structural
  prediction. Here, we design an  algorithm with a new perspective on layered  models;
  we aim to find a fixed-point function  with the structured labels being both the  output
  and the input. Our approach alleviates  the burden in learning multiple/different  classifiers
  in different layers. We devise a  training strategy for our method and provide  justifications
  for the fixed-point function  to be a contraction mapping. The learned  function
  captures rich contextual information  and is easy to train and test. On several  widely
  used benchmark datasets, the proposed  method observes significant improvement  in
  both performance and efficiency over  many state-of-the-art algorithms.'
