title: Multi-View Clustering and Feature Learning via Structured Sparsity
abstract: Combining information from various data sources has become an important
  research topic in machine learning with many scientific applications. Most previous
  studies employ kernels or graphs to integrate different types of features, which
  routinely assume one weight for one type of features. However, for many problems,
  the importance of features in one source to an individual cluster of data can be
  varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this paper, we propose
  a novel multi-view learning model to integrate all features and learn the weight
  for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint structured
  sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not
  only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by
  an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm
  is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on
  its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view
  data sets for both clustering and classification. In all experimental results, our
  method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.
