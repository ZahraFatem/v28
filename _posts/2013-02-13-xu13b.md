title: Anytime Representation Learning
abstract: "Evaluation cost during test-time is becoming increasingly important as
  many real-world applications need fast evaluation (e.g. web search engines, email
  spam filtering) or use expensive features (e.g. medical diagnosis). We introduce
  Anytime Feature Representations (AFR), a novel algorithm that explicitly addresses
  this trade-off in the data representation rather than in the classifier. This enables
  us to turn conventional classifiers, in particular Support Vector Machines, into
  test-time cost sensitive anytime classifiers\x1A combining the advantages of anytime
  learning and large-margin classification."
