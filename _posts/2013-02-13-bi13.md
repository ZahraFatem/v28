title: Efficient Multi-label Classification with Many Labels
abstract: 'Multi-label classification deals with the problem where each instance can
  be associated with a set of class labels. However, in many real-world applications,
  the number of class labels can be in the hundreds or even thousands, and existing
  multi-label classification methods often become computationally inefficient. In
  recent years, a number of remedies have been proposed. However, they are either
  based on simple dimension reduction techniques or involve expensive optimization
  problems. In this paper, we address this problem by selecting a small subset of
  class labels that can approximately span the original label space. This is performed
  by randomized sampling where the sampling probability of each class label reflects
  its importance among all the labels. Theoretical analysis shows that this randomized
  sampling approach is highly efficient. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-label
  datasets with many labels demonstrate the appealing performance and efficiency of
  the proposed algorithm.  '
