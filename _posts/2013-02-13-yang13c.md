title: Activized Learning with Uniform Classification Noise
abstract: We prove that for any VC class, it is possible to transform any passive
  learning algorithm into an active learning algorithm with strong asymptotic improvements
  in label complexity  for every nontrivial distribution satisfying a uniform classification
  noise condition.  This generalizes a similar result proven by  (Hanneke, 2009;2012)
  for the realizable case,  and is the first result establishing that such general
  improvement guarantees are possible  in the presence of restricted types of  classification
  noise.
