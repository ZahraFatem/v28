title: 'Efficient Active Learning of Halfspaces: an Aggressive Approach'
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'We study pool-based active learning of half-spaces. We revisit the aggressive
  approach for active learning in the realizable case, and show that it can be made
  efficient and  practical, while also having theoretical guarantees under reasonable
  assumptions. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it can
  be preferable to mellow approaches.  Our efficient aggressive active learner of
  half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the pool is separable
  with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the realizable setting, we show
  that a simple heuristic allows using the same algorithm successfully for pools with
  low error as well. We further compare the aggressive approach to the mellow approach,
  and prove that there are cases in which the aggressive approach results in significantly
  better label complexity compared to the mellow approach. We demonstrate experimentally
  that substantial improvements in label complexity can be achieved using the aggressive
  approach, for both realizable and low-error settings.  '
