title: A PAC-Bayesian Approach for Domain Adaptation with Specialization to Linear
  Classifiers
abstract: 'We provide a first PAC-Bayesian analysis for domain adaptation (DA) which
  arises when the learning and test distributions differ. It relies on a novel distribution
  pseudodistance based on a disagreement averaging. Using this measure, we derive
  a PAC-Bayesian DA bound for the stochastic Gibbs classifier. This bound has the
  advantage of being directly optimizable for any hypothesis space. We specialize
  it to linear classifiers, and design a learning algorithm which shows interesting
  results on a synthetic problem and on a popular sentiment annotation task. This
  opens the door to tackling DA tasks by making use of all the PAC-Bayesian tools.  '
