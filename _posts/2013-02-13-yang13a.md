title: Mixture of Mutually Exciting Processes for Viral Diffusion
abstract: "\\emphDiffusion network inference and \\emphmeme tracking have been two
  key challenges in viral diffusion. This paper shows that these two tasks can be
  addressed simultaneously with a probabilistic model involving a mixture of mutually
  exciting point processes. A fast learning algorithms is developed based on mean-field
  variational inference with budgeted diffusion bandwidth. The model is demonstrated
  with applications to the diffusion of viral texts in (1) online social networks
  (e.g., Twitter) and (2) the blogosphere on the Web."
