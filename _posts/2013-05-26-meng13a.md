title: Scalable Simple Random Sampling and Stratified Sampling
abstract: Analyzing data sets of billions of records has now become a regular task
  in    many companies and institutions.    In the statistical analysis of those massive
  data sets, sampling generally    plays a very important role.    In this work, we
  describe a scalable simple random sampling algorithm, named    ScaSRS, which uses
  probabilistic thresholds to decide on the fly whether to    accept, reject, or wait-list
  an item independently of others.    We prove, with high probability, it succeeds
  and needs only O(\sqrtk)    storage, where k is the sample size.    ScaSRS extends
  naturally to a scalable stratified sampling algorithm, which is    favorable for
  heterogeneous data sets.    The proposed algorithms, when implemented in MapReduce,
  can effectively reduce    the size of intermediate output and greatly improve load
  balancing.    Empirical evaluation on large-scale data sets clearly demonstrates
  their    superiority.
