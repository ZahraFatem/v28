title: On learning parametric-output HMMs
abstract: 'We present a novel approach to learning an HMM whose outputs are distributed
  according to a parametric family. This is done by \em decoupling the learning task
  into two steps: first estimating the output parameters, and then estimating the
  hidden states transition probabilities. The first step is accomplished by fitting
  a mixture model to the output stationary distribution. Given the parameters of this
  mixture model, the second step is formulated as the solution of an easily solvable
  convex quadratic program. We provide an error analysis for the estimated transition
  probabilities and show they are robust to small perturbations in the estimates of
  the mixture parameters. Finally, we support our analysis with some encouraging empirical
  results.'
