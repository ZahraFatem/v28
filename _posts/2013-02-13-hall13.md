title: Dynamical Models and tracking regret in online convex programming
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: This paper describes a new online convex optimization method which incorporates
  a family of candidate dynamical models and establishes novel tracking regret bounds
  that scale with comparatorâ€™s deviation from the best dynamical model in this family.
  Previous online optimization methods are designed to have a total accumulated loss
  comparable to that of the best comparator sequence, and existing tracking or shifting
  regret bounds scale with the overall variation of the comparator sequence. In many
  practical scenarios, however, the environment is nonstationary and comparator sequences
  with small variation are quite weak, resulting in large losses. The proposed dynamic
  mirror descent method, in contrast, can yield low regret relative to highly variable
  comparator sequences by both tracking the best dynamical model and forming predictions
  based on that model. This concept is demonstrated empirically in the context of
  sequential compressive observations of a dynamic scene and tracking a dynamic social
  network.
