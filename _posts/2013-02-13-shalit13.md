title: Modeling Musical Influence with Topic Models
abstract: 'The role of musical influence has long been debated by scholars  and critics
  in the humanities, but never in a data-driven way.  In this work we approach the
  question of influence by applying topic-modeling tools (Blei & Lafferty, 2006; Gerrish
  & Blei, 2010) to a dataset of 24941 songs by 9222 artists, from the years 1922 to
  2010. We find the models to be significantly correlated with a human-curated influence
  measure, and to clearly outperform a baseline method. Further using the learned
  model to study properties of influence, we find that musical influence and musical
  innovation are not monotonically correlated. However, we do find that the most influential
  songs were more innovative during two time periods: the early 1970’s and the mid
  1990’s.'
