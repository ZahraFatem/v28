title: The Extended Parameter Filter
abstract: The parameters of temporal models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, may
  be modelled in a Bayesian context as static or atemporal variables that influence
  transition probabilities at every time step. Particle filters fail for models that
  include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables
  may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation
  sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient
  statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant.  In
  this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik’s filter and a Kalman filter
  in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik’s filter
  works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze,
  both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior
  that allows Storvik’s method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments
  on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing
  methods.
