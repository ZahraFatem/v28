title: Stochastic Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization
abstract: We study the problem of global maximization of a function f given a finite
  number of evaluations perturbed by noise. We consider a very weak assumption on
  the function, namely that it is locally smooth (in some precise sense) with respect
  to some semi-metric, around one of its global maxima. Compared to previous works
  on bandits in general spaces (Kleinberg et al., 2008; Bubeck et al., 2011a) our
  algorithm does not require the knowledge of this semi-metric. Our algorithm, StoSOO,
  follows an optimistic strategy to iteratively construct upper confidence bounds
  over the hierarchical partitions of the function domain to decide which point to
  sample next. A finite-time analysis of StoSOO shows that it performs almost as well
  as the best specifically-tuned algorithms even though the local smoothness of the
  function is not known.
