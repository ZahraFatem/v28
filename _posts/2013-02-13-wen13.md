title: Sequential Bayesian Search
abstract: Millions of people search daily for movies, music, and books on the Internet.
  Unfortunately, non-personalized exploration of items can result in an infeasible
  number of costly interaction steps. We study the problem of efficient, repeated
  interactive search. In this problem, the user is navigated to the items of interest
  through a series of options and our objective is to learn a better search policy
  from past interactions with the user. We propose an efficient learning algorithm
  for solving the problem, sequential Bayesian search (SBS), and prove that it is
  Bayesian optimal. We also analyze the algorithm from the frequentist point of view
  and show that its regret is sublinear in the number of searches. Finally, we evaluate
  our method on a real-world movie discovery problem and show that it performs nearly
  optimally as the number of searches increases.
