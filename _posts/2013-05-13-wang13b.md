title: 'Subproblem-Tree Calibration: A Unified Approach to Max-Product Message Passing'
abstract: "Max-product (max-sum) message passing algorithms are widely used for MAP
  inference in MRFs. It has many variants sharing a common flavor of passing ""messages""
  over some graph-object. Recent advances revealed that its convergent versions (such
  as MPLP, MSD, TRW-S) can be viewed as performing block coordinate descent (BCD)
  in a dual objective. That is, each BCD step achieves dual-optimal w.r.t. a block
  of dual variables (messages), thereby decreases the dual objective monotonically.
  However, most existing algorithms are limited to updating blocks selected in rather
  restricted ways. In this paper, we show a ""unified"" message passing algorithm
  that: (a) subsumes MPLP, MSD, and TRW-S as special cases when applied to their respective
  choices of dual objective and blocks, and (b) is able to perform BCD under much
  more flexible choices of blocks (including very large blocks) as well as the dual
  objective itself (that arise from an arbitrary dual decomposition)."
