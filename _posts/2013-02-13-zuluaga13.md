title: Active Learning for Multi-Objective Optimization
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying, out of a pool
  of possible designs, those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. This
  means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal
  ones with optimal tradeoffs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating
  one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is
  unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL)
  algorithm, which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal
  set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian
  process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2)
  a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and
  (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical
  bounds on PAL’s sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we
  show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show
  PAL’s effectiveness; in particular it improves significantly over a state-of-the-art
  evolutionary algorithm, saving in many cases about 33%.
