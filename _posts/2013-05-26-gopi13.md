title: 'One-Bit Compressed Sensing: Provable Support and Vector Recovery'
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the problem of one-bit compressed sensing (1-bit
  CS), where the goal is to design a measurement matrix A and a recovery algorithm
  s.t. a k-sparse vector \x^* can be efficiently recovered back from signed linear
  measurements, i.e., b=\sign(A\x^*). This is an important problem in the signal acquisition
  area and has several learning applications as well, e.g., multi-label classification
  \citeHsuKLZ10. We study this problem in two settings: a) support recovery: recover
  \supp(\x^*), b) approximate vector recovery: recover a unit vector \hx s.t. || \hatx-\x^*/||\x^*||
  ||_2≤ε. For support recovery, we propose two novel and efficient solutions based
  on two combinatorial structures: union free family of sets and expanders. In contrast
  to  existing methods for  support recovery, our methods are universal i.e. a single
  measurement matrix A can recover almost all the signals. For approximate recovery,
  we propose the first  method to recover sparse vector using a near optimal number
  of measurements.  We also empirically demonstrate  effectiveness of our algorithms;
  we show that our algorithms are able to recover signals with smaller number of measurements
  than several existing methods. '
