title: Learning from Human-Generated Lists
abstract: 'Human-generated lists are a form of non-iid data with important applications
  in machine learning and cognitive psychology. We propose a generative model - sampling
  with reduced replacement (SWIRL) - for such lists. We discuss SWIRLâ€™s relation to
  standard sampling paradigms, provide the maximum likelihood estimate for learning,
  and demonstrate its value with two real-world applications: (i) In a ""feature volunteering""
  task where non-experts spontaneously generate feature=>label pairs for text classification,
  SWIRL improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art feature-learning frameworks. (ii)
  In a ""verbal fluency"" task where brain-damaged patients generate word lists when
  prompted with a category, SWIRL parameters align well with existing psychological
  theories, and our model can classify healthy people vs. patients from the lists
  they generate.    '
