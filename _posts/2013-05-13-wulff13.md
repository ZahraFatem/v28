title: Monochromatic Bi-Clustering
abstract: We propose a natural cost function for the bi-clustering task, the monochromatic
  cost.  This cost function is suitable for detecting meaningful homogeneous bi-clusters
  based on categorical valued input matrices. Such tasks arise in many applications,
  such as the analysis of social networks and in systems-biology where researchers
  try to infer functional grouping of biological agents based on their pairwise interactions.
  We analyze the computational complexity of the resulting optimization problem. We
  present a polynomial time approximation algorithm for this bi-clustering task and
  complement this result by showing that finding (exact) optimal solutions is NP-hard.
  As far as we know, these are the first positive approximation guarantees  and formal
  NP-hardness results  for any bi-clustering optimization problem.  In addition, we
  show that our optimization problem can be efficiently  solved by deterministic annealing,  yielding
  a promising heuristic for large problem instances.
