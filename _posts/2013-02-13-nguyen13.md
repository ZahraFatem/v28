title: Online Feature Selection for Model-based Reinforcement Learning
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'We propose a new framework for learning the world dynamics of feature-rich
  environments in model-based reinforcement learning. The main idea is formalized
  as a new, factored state-transition representation that supports efficient online-learning
  of the relevant features. We construct the transition models through predicting
  how the actions change the world. We introduce an online sparse coding learning
  technique for feature selection in high-dimensional spaces. We derive theoretical
  guarantees for our framework and empirically demonstrate its practicality in both
  simulated and real robotics domains.  '
