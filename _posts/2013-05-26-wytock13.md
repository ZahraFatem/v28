title: 'Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields: Algorithms, Theory, and Application
  to Energy Forecasting'
abstract: 'This paper considers the sparse Gaussian conditional random field, a discriminative
  extension of sparse inverse covariance estimation, where we use convex methods to
  learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of outputs given inputs. The model
  has been proposed by multiple researchers within the past year, yet previous papers
  have been substantially limited in their analysis of the method and in the ability
  to solve large-scale problems.  In this paper, we make three contributions: 1) we
  develop a second-order active-set method which is several orders of magnitude faster
  that previously proposed optimization approaches for this problem 2) we analyze
  the model from a theoretical standpoint, improving upon past bounds with convergence
  rates that depend logarithmically on the data dimension, and 3) we apply the method
  to large-scale energy forecasting problems, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
  on two real-world tasks.'
