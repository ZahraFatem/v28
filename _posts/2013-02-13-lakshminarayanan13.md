title: Top-down particle filtering for Bayesian decision trees
abstract: "Decision tree learning is a popular approach for classification and regression
  in machine learning and statistics, and Bayesian formulations\x1Awhich introduce
  a prior distribution over decision trees, and formulate learning as posterior inference
  given data\x1Ahave been shown to produce competitive performance. Unlike classic
  decision tree learning algorithms like ID3, C4.5 and CART, which work in a top-down
  manner, existing Bayesian algorithms produce an approximation to the posterior distribution
  by evolving a complete tree (or collection thereof) iteratively via local Monte
  Carlo modifications to the structure of the tree, e.g., using Markov chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC). We present a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that instead works
  in a top-down manner, mimicking the behavior and speed of classic algorithms. We
  demonstrate empirically that our approach delivers accuracy comparable to the most
  popular MCMC method, but operates more than an order of magnitude faster, and thus
  represents a better computation-accuracy tradeoff."
