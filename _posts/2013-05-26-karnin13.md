title: Almost Optimal Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: 'We study the problem of exploration in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits.
  Even in the simplest setting of identifying the best arm, there remains a logarithmic
  multiplicative gap between the known lower and upper bounds for the number of arm
  pulls required for the task. This extra logarithmic factor is quite meaningful in
  nowadays large-scale applications. We present two novel, parameter-free algorithms
  for identifying the best arm, in two different settings: given a target confidence
  and given a target budget of arm pulls, for which we prove upper bounds whose gap
  from the lower bound is only doubly-logarithmic in the problem parameters. We corroborate
  our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms
  the state-of-the-art and scales better as the size of the problem increases.  '
