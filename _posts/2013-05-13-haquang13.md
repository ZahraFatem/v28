title: A unifying framework for vector-valued manifold regularization and multi-view
  learning
abstract: 'This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert
  spaces (RKHS) formulation for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency  between
  a structured input space and a structured output space, in the Semi-Supervised Learning
  setting. Our formulation includes as special cases Vector-valued Manifold Regularization
  and Multi-view Learning, thus provides in particular a unifying framework linking
  these two important learning approaches.  In the case of least square loss function,
  we provide a closed form solution with an efficient implementation. Numerical experiments
  on challenging multi-class categorization problems show that our multi-view learning
  formulation achieves results which are comparable with state of the art and are
  significantly better than single-view learning.  '
