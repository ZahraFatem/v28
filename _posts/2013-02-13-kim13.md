title: A Variational Approximation for Topic Modeling of Hierarchical Corpora
abstract: We study the problem of topic modeling in corpora whose documents are organized
  in a multi-level hierarchy.  We explore a parametric approach to this problem, assuming
  that the number of topics is known or can be estimated by cross-validation.  The
  models we consider can be viewed as special (finite-dimensional) instances of hierarchical
  Dirichlet processes (HDPs).  For these models we show that there exists a simple
  variational approximation for probabilistic inference.  The approximation relies
  on a previously unexploited inequality that handles the conditional dependence between
  Dirichlet latent variables in adjacent levels of the model’s hierarchy.  We compare
  our approach to existing implementations of nonparametric HDPs.  On several benchmarks
  we find that our approach is faster than Gibbs sampling and able to learn more predictive
  models than existing variational methods.  Finally, we demonstrate the large-scale
  viability of our approach on two newly available corpora from researchers in computer
  security–one with 350,000 documents and over 6,000 internal subcategories, the other
  with a five-level deep hierarchy.
