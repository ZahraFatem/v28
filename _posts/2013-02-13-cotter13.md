title: Learning Optimally Sparse Support Vector Machines
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: We show how to train SVMs with an optimal guarantee on the number of support
  vectors (up to constants), and with sample complexity and training runtime bounds
  matching the best known for kernel SVM optimization (i.e. without any additional
  asymptotic cost beyond standard SVM training). Our method is simple to implement
  and works well in practice.
