title: Tensor Analyzers
abstract: Factor Analysis is a statistical method that seeks to explain linear variations
  in data by using unobserved latent variables. Due to its additive nature, it is
  not suitable for modeling data that is generated by multiple groups of latent factors
  which interact multiplicatively. In this paper, we introduce Tensor Analyzers which
  are a multilinear generalization of Factor Analyzers. We describe an efficient way
  of sampling from the posterior distribution over factor values and we demonstrate
  that these samples can be used in the EM algorithm for learning interesting mixture
  models of natural image patches. Tensor Analyzers can also accurately recognize
  a face under significant pose and illumination variations when given only one previous
  image of that face. We also show that Tensor Analyzers can be trained in an unsupervised,
  semi-supervised, or fully supervised settings.
