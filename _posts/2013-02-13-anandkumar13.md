title: Learning Linear Bayesian Networks with Latent Variables
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'This work considers the problem of learning linear Bayesian networks when  some
  of the variables are unobserved.  Identifiability and efficient recovery from low-order
  observable moments  are established under a novel graphical constraint.  The constraint
  concerns the expansion properties of the underlying directed  acyclic graph (DAG)
  between observed and unobserved variables in the  network, and it is satisfied by
  many natural families of DAGs that include  multi-level DAGs, DAGs with effective
  depth one, as well as certain  families of polytrees.  '
