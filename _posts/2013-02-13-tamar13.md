title: Temporal Difference Methods for the Variance of the Reward To Go
abstract: In this paper we extend temporal difference policy evaluation algorithms
  to performance criteria that include the variance of the cumulative reward. Such
  criteria are useful for risk management, and are important in domains such as finance
  and process control. We propose variants of both TD(0) and LSTD(Î») with linear function
  approximation, prove their convergence, and demonstrate their utility in a 4-dimensional
  continuous state space problem.
