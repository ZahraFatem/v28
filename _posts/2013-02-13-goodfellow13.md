title: Maxout Networks
abstract: "We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced
  approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We de\x1Ane a simple new model
  called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because
  it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by
  dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout\x1As fast approximate model averaging
  technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of
  these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classi\x1Acation
  performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.  "
