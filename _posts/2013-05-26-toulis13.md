title: Estimation of Causal Peer Influence Effects
abstract: 'The broad adoption of social media has generated interest in leveraging
  peer influence for inducing desired user behavior. Quantifying the causal effect
  of peer influence presents technical challenges, however, including how to deal
  with social interference, complex response functions and network uncertainty. In
  this paper, we extend potential outcomes to allow for interference, we introduce
  well-defined causal estimands of peer-influence, and we develop two estimation procedures:
  a frequentist procedure relying on a sequential randomization design that requires
  knowledge of the network but operates under complicated response functions, and
  a Bayesian procedure which accounts for network uncertainty but relies on a linear
  response assumption to increase estimation precision. Our results show the advantages
  and disadvantages of the proposed methods in a number of situations.'
