title: Semi-supervised Clustering by Input Pattern Assisted Pairwise Similarity Matrix
  Completion
abstract: Many semi-supervised clustering algorithms have been proposed to improve
  the clustering accuracy by effectively exploring the available side information
  that is usually in the form of pairwise constraints. Despite the progress, there
  are two main shortcomings of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms.
  First, they have to deal with non-convex optimization problems, leading to clustering
  results that are sensitive to the initialization. Second, none of these algorithms
  is equipped with theoretical guarantee regarding the clustering performance. We
  address these limitations by developing a framework for semi-supervised clustering
  based on \it input pattern assisted matrix completion. The key idea is to cast clustering
  into a matrix completion problem, and solve it efficiently by exploiting the correlation
  between input patterns and cluster assignments. Our analysis shows that under appropriate
  conditions, only O(\log n) pairwise constraints are needed to accurately recover
  the true cluster partition. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
  by comparing it to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms on
  several benchmark datasets.
