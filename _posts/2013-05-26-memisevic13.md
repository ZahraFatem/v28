title: Learning invariant features by harnessing the aperture problem
abstract: 'The energy model is a simple, biologically inspired approach to extracting
  relationships between images in tasks like stereopsis and motion analysis. We discuss
  how adding an extra pooling layer to the energy model makes it possible to learn
  encodings of transformations that are mostly invariant with respect to image content,
  and to learn encodings of images that are mostly invariant with respect to the observed
  transformations. We show how this makes it possible to learn 3D pose-invariant features
  of objects by watching videos of the objects. We test our approach on a dataset
  of videos derived from the NORB dataset.  '
