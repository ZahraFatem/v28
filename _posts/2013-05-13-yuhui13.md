title: Direct Modeling of Complex Invariances for Visual Object Features
abstract: View-invariant object representations created from feature pooling networks
  have been widely adopted in state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. Recently,
  the research community seeks to improve these view-invariant representations further
  by additional invariance and receptive field learning, or by taking on the challenge
  of processing massive amounts of learning data. In this paper we consider an alternate
  strategy of directly modeling complex invariances of object features. While this
  may sound like a naive and inferior approach, our experiments show that this approach
  can achieve competitive and state-of-the-art accuracy on visual recognition data
  sets such as CIFAR-10 and STL-10. We present an highly applicable dictionary learning
  algorithm on complex invariances that can be used in most feature pooling network
  settings. It also has the merits of simplicity and requires no additional tuning.
  We also discuss the implication of our experiment results concerning recent observations
  on the usefulness of pre-trained features, and the role of direct invariance modeling
  in invariance learning.
