title: Human Boosting
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: Humans may be exceptional learners but they have biological limitations
  and moreover, inductive biases similar to machine learning algorithms. This puts
  limits on human learning ability and on the kinds of learning tasks humans can easily
  handle. In this paper, we consider the problem of “boosting” human learners to extend
  the learning ability of human learners and achieve improved performance on tasks
  which individual humans find difficult. We consider classification (category learning)
  tasks, propose a boosting algorithm for human learners and give theoretical justifications.
  We conduct experiments using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk on two synthetic datasets
  – a crosshair task with a nonlinear decision boundary and a gabor patch task with
  a linear boundary but which is inaccessible to human learners – and one real world
  dataset – the Opinion Spam detection task introduced in (Ott et al). Our results
  show that boosting human learners produces gains in accuracy and can overcome some
  fundamental limitations of human learners.
