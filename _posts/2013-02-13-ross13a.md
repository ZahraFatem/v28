title: Nonparametric Mixture of Gaussian Processes with Constraints
abstract: Motivated by the need to identify new and clinically relevant categories
  of lung disease, we propose a novel clustering with constraints method using a Dirichlet
  process mixture of Gaussian processes in a variational Bayesian nonparametric framework.
  We claim that individuals should be grouped according to biological and/or genetic
  similarity regardless of their level of disease severity; therefore, we introduce
  a new way of looking at subtyping/clustering by recasting it in terms of discovering
  associations of individuals to disease trajectories (i.e., grouping individuals
  based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables).
  The nonparametric nature of our algorithm allows for learning the unknown number
  of meaningful trajectories. Additionally, we acknowledge the usefulness of expert
  guidance by providing for their input using must-link and cannot- link constraints.
  These constraints are encoded with Markov random fields. We also provide an efficient
  variational approach for performing inference on our model.
