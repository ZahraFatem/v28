title: Concurrent Reinforcement Learning from Customer Interactions
abstract: 'In this paper, we explore applications in which a company interacts concurrently
  with many customers. The company has an objective function, such as maximising revenue,
  customer satisfaction, or customer loyalty, which depends primarily on the sequence
  of interactions between company and customer. A key aspect of this setting is that
  interactions with different customers occur in parallel. As a result, it is imperative
  to learn online from partial interaction sequences, so that information acquired
  from one customer is efficiently assimilated and applied in subsequent interactions
  with other customers. We present the first framework for concurrent reinforcement
  learning, using a variant of temporal-difference learning to learn efficiently from
  partial interaction sequences.   We evaluate our algorithms in two large-scale test-beds
  for online and email interaction respectively, generated from a database of 300,000
  customer records. '
