title: Online Learning under Delayed Feedback
abstract: Online learning with delayed feedback has received increasing attention
  recently due to its several applications in distributed, web-based learning problems.
  In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze the effect
  of delay on the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it
  turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial
  problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms
  that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed
  case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications
  of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed
  feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented
  with lower complexity.
