title: Discriminatively Activated Sparselets
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: Shared representations are highly appealing due to their potential  for
  gains in computational and statistical efficiency.  Compressing  a shared representation
  leads to greater computational savings, but  at the same time can severely decrease
  performance on a target task.  Recently, sparselets (Song et al., 2012) were introduced
  as a new  shared intermediate representation for multiclass object detection  with
  deformable part models (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010a), showing  significant speedup
  factors, but with a large decrease in task  performance.  In this paper we describe
  a new training framework  that learns which sparselets to activate in order to optimize
  a  discriminative objective, leading to larger speedup factors with  no decrease
  in task performance.  We first reformulate sparselets  in a general structured output
  prediction framework, then analyze  when sparselets lead to computational efficiency
  gains, and lastly  show experimental results on object detection and image classification  tasks.  Our
  experimental results demonstrate that discriminative  activation substantially outperforms
  the previous reconstructive  approach which, together with our structured output
  prediction  formulation, make sparselets broadly applicable and significantly  more
  effective.
