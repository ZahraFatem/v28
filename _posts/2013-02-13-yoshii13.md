title: Infinite Positive Semidefinite Tensor Factorization for Source Separation of
  Mixture Signals
abstract: This paper presents a new class of tensor factorization called positive
  semidefinite tensor factorization (PSDTF) that decomposes a set of positive semidefinite
  (PSD) matrices into the convex combinations of fewer PSD basis matrices. PSDTF can
  be viewed as a natural extension of nonnegative matrix factorization. One of the
  main problems of PSDTF is that an appropriate number of bases should be given in
  advance. To solve this problem, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model based
  on a gamma process that can instantiate only a limited number of necessary bases
  from the infinitely many bases assumed to exist. We derive a variational Bayesian
  algorithm for closed-form posterior inference and a multiplicative update rule for
  maximum-likelihood estimation. We evaluated PSDTF on both synthetic data and real
  music recordings to show its superiority.
