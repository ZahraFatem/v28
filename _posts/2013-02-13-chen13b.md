title: Near-optimal Batch Mode Active Learning and Adaptive Submodular Optimization
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: Active learning can lead to a dramatic reduction in labeling effort. However,
  in many practical implementations (such as crowdsourcing,  surveys, high-throughput
  experimental design), it is preferable to query labels for batches of examples to
  be labelled in parallel. While several heuristics have been proposed for batch-mode
  active learning, little is known about their theoretical performance.    We consider
  batch mode active learning and more general information-parallel stochastic optimization
  problems that exhibit adaptive submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition.
  We prove that for such problems, a simple greedy strategy is competitive with the
  optimal batch-mode policy. In some cases, surprisingly, the use of batches incurs
  competitively low cost, even when compared to a fully sequential strategy. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach on batch-mode active learning tasks, where it
  outperforms the state of the art, as well as the novel problem of multi-stage influence
  maximization in social networks.
