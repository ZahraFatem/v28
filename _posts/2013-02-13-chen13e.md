title: General Functional Matrix Factorization Using Gradient Boosting
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: Matrix factorization is among the most successful techniques for collaborative
  filtering. One challenge of collaborative filtering is how to utilize available
  auxiliary information to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we study the  problem
  of utilizing auxiliary information as features of   factorization and propose formalizing
  the problem as general functional matrix factorization, whose model includes conventional
  matrix factorization models as its special cases. Moreover, we propose a gradient
  boosting based algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally,
  we give two specific algorithms for efficient feature function construction for
  two specific tasks. Our method can construct more suitable feature functions by
  searching in an infinite functional space based on training data and thus can yield
  better prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  method outperforms the baseline methods on three real-world datasets.
