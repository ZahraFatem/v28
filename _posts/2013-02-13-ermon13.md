title: 'Taming the Curse of Dimensionality: Discrete Integration by Hashing and Optimization'
abstract: Integration is affected by the curse of dimensionality and quickly becomes
  intractable as the dimensionality of the problem grows. We propose a randomized
  algorithm that, with high probability, gives a constant-factor approximation of
  a general discrete integral defined over an exponentially large set. This algorithm
  relies on solving only a small number of instances of a discrete combinatorial optimization
  problem subject to randomly generated parity constraints used as a hash function.
  As an application, we demonstrate that with a small number of MAP queries we can
  efficiently approximate the partition function of discrete graphical models, which
  can in turn be used, for instance, for marginal computation or model selection.
