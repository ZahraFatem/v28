title: 'Topic Model Diagnostics: Assessing Domain Relevance via Topical Alignment'
abstract: 'The use of topic models to analyze domain-specific texts often requires
  manual validation of the latent topics to ensure they are meaningful. We introduce
  a framework to support large-scale assessment of topical relevance. We measure the
  correspondence between a set of latent topics and a set of reference concepts to
  quantify four types of topical misalignment: junk, fused, missing, and repeated
  topics. Our analysis compares 10,000 topic model variants to 200 expert-provided
  domain concepts, and demonstrates how our framework can inform choices of model
  parameters, inference algorithms, and intrinsic measures of topical quality.'
