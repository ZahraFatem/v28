title: Guided Policy Search
abstract: Direct policy search can effectively scale to high-dimensional systems,
  but complex policies with hundreds of parameters often present a challenge for such
  methods, requiring numerous samples and often falling into poor local optima. We
  present a guided policy search algorithm that uses trajectory optimization to direct
  policy learning and avoid poor local optima. We show how differential dynamic programming
  can be used to generate suitable guiding samples, and describe a regularized importance
  sampled policy optimization that incorporates these samples into the policy search.
  We evaluate the method by learning neural network controllers for planar swimming,
  hopping, and walking, as well as simulated 3D humanoid running.
