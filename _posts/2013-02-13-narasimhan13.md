title: A Structural SVM Based Approach for Optimizing Partial AUC
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure
  in machine learning. Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from
  ranking and biometric screening to medical diagnosis, performance is measured not
  in terms of the full area under the ROC curve, but instead, in terms of the partial
  area under the ROC curve between two specified false positive rates. In this paper,
  we develop a structural SVM framework for directly optimizing the partial AUC between
  any two false positive rates. Our approach makes use of a cutting plane solver along
  the lines of the structural SVM based approach for optimizing the full AUC developed
  by Joachims (2005). Unlike the full AUC, where the combinatorial optimization problem
  needed to find the most violated constraint in the cutting plane solver can be decomposed
  easily to yield an efficient algorithm, the corresponding optimization problem in
  the case of partial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our key technical contributions
  is an efficient algorithm for solving this combinatorial optimization problem that
  has the same computational complexity as Joachimsâ€™ algorithm for optimizing the
  usual AUC. This allows us to efficiently optimize the partial AUC in any desired
  false positive range. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of real-world tasks.
