title: One-Pass AUC Optimization
abstract: AUC is an important performance measure and many algorithms have been devoted
  to AUC optimization, mostly by minimizing a surrogate convex loss on a training
  data set. In this work, we focus on one-pass AUC optimization that requires only
  going through the training data once without storing the entire training dataset,
  where conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied directly because
  AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of instances from different
  classes. We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the
  first and second order statistics of training data in memory, resulting a storage
  requirement independent from the size of training data. To efficiently handle high
  dimensional data, we develop a randomized algorithm that approximates the covariance
  matrices by low rank matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the
  effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
