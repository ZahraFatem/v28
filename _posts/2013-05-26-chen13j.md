title: Fast Image Tagging
abstract: Automatic image annotation is a difficult and highly relevant machine learning
  task. Recent advances have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in retrieval
  accuracy with algorithms based on nearest neighbor classification in carefully learned
  metric spaces. But this comes at a price of increased computational complexity during
  training and testing. We propose FastTag, a novel algorithm that achieves comparable
  results with two simple linear mappings that are co-regularized in a joint convex
  loss function. The loss function can be efficiently optimized in closed form updates,
  which allows us to incorporate a large number of image descriptors cheaply. On several
  standard real-world benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that FastTag matches the
  current state-of-the-art in tagging quality, yet reduces the training and testing
  times by several orders of magnitude and has lower asymptotic complexity.
