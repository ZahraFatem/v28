title: Riemannian Similarity Learning
abstract: We consider a similarity-score based paradigm to address scenarios where
  either the class labels are only partially revealed during learning, or the training
  and testing data are drawn from heterogeneous sources. The learning problem is subsequently
  formulated as optimization over a bilinear form of fixed rank. Our paradigm bears
  similarity to metric learning, where the major difference lies in its aim of learning
  a rectangular similarity matrix, instead of a proper metric. We tackle this problem
  in a Riemannian optimization framework. In particular, we consider its applications
  in pairwise-based action recognition, and cross-domain image-based object recognition.
  In both applications, the proposed algorithm produces competitive performance on
  respective benchmark datasets.
