title: Cost-Sensitive Tree of Classifiers
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: Recently, machine learning algorithms have successfully entered large-scale
  real-world industrial applications (e.g. search engines and email spam filters).
  Here, the CPU cost during test-time must be budgeted and accounted for. In this
  paper, we address the challenge of balancing test-time cost and the classifier accuracy
  in a principled fashion. The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by
  the computation required for feature extraction-which can vary drastically across
  features. We incorporate this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers,
  through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different
  features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. By only
  computing features for inputs that benefit from them the most, our cost-sensitive
  tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current state-of-the-art
  at a small fraction of the computational cost.
