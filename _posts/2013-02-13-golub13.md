title: Learning an Internal Dynamics Model from Control Demonstration
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'Much work in optimal control and inverse control has assumed that the controller
  has perfect knowledge of plant dynamics.  However, if the controller is a human
  or animal subject, the subject’s internal dynamics model may differ from the true
  plant dynamics.  Here, we consider the problem of learning the subject’s internal
  model from demonstrations of control and knowledge of task goals.  Due to sensory
  feedback delay, the subject uses an internal model to generate an internal prediction
  of the current plant state, which may differ from the actual plant state.  We develop
  a probabilistic framework and exact EM algorithm to jointly estimate the internal
  model, internal state trajectories, and feedback delay. We applied this framework
  to demonstrations by a nonhuman primate of brain-machine interface (BMI) control.
  We discovered that the subject’s internal model deviated from the true BMI plant
  dynamics and provided significantly better explanation of the recorded neural control
  signals than did the true plant dynamics. '
