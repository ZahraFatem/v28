title: Strict Monotonicity of Sum of Squares Error  and Normalized Cut in the Lattice
  of Clusterings
abstract: Sum of Squares Error and Normalized Cut are two widely used clustering functional.
  It is known their minimum values are monotone with respect to the input number of
  clusters and this monotonicity does not allow for a simple automatic selection of
  a correct number of clusters. Here we study monotonicity not just on the minimizers
  but on the entire clustering lattice. We show the value of Sum of Squares Error
  is strictly monotone under the strict refinement relation of clusterings and we
  obtain data-dependent bounds on the difference between the value of a clustering
  and one of its refinements. Using analogous techniques we show the value of Normalized
  Cut is strictly anti-monotone. These results imply that even if we restrict our
  solutions to form a chain of clustering, like the one we get from hierarchical algorithms,
  we cannot rely on the functional values in order to choose the number of clusters.
  By using these results we get some data-dependent bounds on the difference of the
  values of any two clusterings.
