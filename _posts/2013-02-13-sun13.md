title: 'Saving Evaluation Time for the Decision Function in Boosting: Representation
  and Reordering Base Learner'
abstract: 'For a well trained Boosting classifier, we are interested in how to save
  the testing time, i.e., to make the decision without evaluating all the base learners.
  To address this problem, in previous work the base learners are sequentially calculated
  and early stopping is allowed if the decision function has been confident enough
  to output its value. In such a chain structure, the order of base learners is critical:
  better order can lead to less evaluation time.    In this paper, we present a novel
  method for ordering. We base our discussion on the data structure representing Boostingâ€™s
  decision function. Viewing the decision function a boolean expression, we propose
  a Binary Valued Tree for its representation. As a secondary contribution, such a
  representation unifies the work by previous researchers and helps devise new representation.
  Also, its connection to Binary Decision Diagram(BDD) is discussed.'
