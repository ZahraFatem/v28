title: Generic Exploration and {K}-armed Voting Bandits
abstract: We study a stochastic online learning scheme with partial feedback where
  the utility of decisions is only observable through an estimation of the environment
  parameters. We propose a generic pure-exploration algorithm, able to cope with various
  utility functions from multi-armed bandits settings to dueling bandits. The primary
  application of this setting is to offer a natural generalization of dueling bandits
  for situations where the environment parameters reflect the idiosyncratic preferences
  of a mixed crowd.
