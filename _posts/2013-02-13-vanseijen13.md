title: Planning by Prioritized Sweeping with Small Backups
abstract: 'Efficient planning plays a crucial role in model-based reinforcement learning.
  Traditionally, the main planning operation is a full backup based on the current
  estimates of the successor states. Consequently, its computation time is proportional
  to the number of successor states. In this paper, we introduce a new planning backup
  that  uses only the current value of a single successor state and has a computation
  time independent of the number of successor states. This new backup, which we call
  a small backup, opens the door to a new class of model-based reinforcement learning
  methods that exhibit much finer control over their planning process than traditional
  methods. We empirically demonstrate that this increased flexibility allows for more
  efficient planning by showing that an implementation of prioritized sweeping based
  on small backups achieves a substantial performance improvement over classical implementations. '
