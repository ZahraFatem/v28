title: Non-Linear Stationary Subspace Analysis with Application to Video Classification
abstract: 'Low-dimensional representations are key to the success of many video classification
  algorithms. However, the commonly-used dimensionality reduction techniques fail
  to account for the fact that only part of the signal is shared across all the videos
  in one class. As a consequence, the resulting representations contain instance-specific
  information, which introduces noise in the classification process. In this paper,
  we introduce Non-Linear Stationary Subspace Analysis: A method that overcomes this
  issue by explicitly separating the stationary parts of the video signal (i.e., the
  parts shared across all videos in one class), from its non-stationary parts (i.e.,
  specific to individual videos). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
  on action recognition, dynamic texture classification and scene recognition.'
