title: Simple Sparsification Improves Sparse Denoising Autoencoders in Denoising Highly
  Corrupted Images
abstract: Recently Burger et al. (2012) and Xie et al. (2012) proposed to use a denoising
  autoencoder (DAE) for denoising noisy images. They showed that a plain, deep DAE
  can denoise noisy images as well as the conventional methods such as BM3D and KSVD.
  Both of them approached image denoising by denoising small, image patches of a larger
  image and combining them to form a clean image. In this setting, it is usual to
  use the encoder of the DAE to obtain the latent representation and subsequently
  apply the decoder to get the clean patch. We propose that a simple sparsification
  of the latent representation found by the encoder improves denoising performance,
  when the DAE was trained with sparsity regularization. The experiments confirm that
  the proposed sparsification indeed helps both denoising a small image patch and
  denoising a larger image consisting of those patches. Furthermore, it is found out
  that the proposed method improves even classification performance when test samples
  are corrupted with noise.
