title: Cost-sensitive Multiclass Classification Risk Bounds
abstract: A commonly used approach to multiclass classification is to replace the
  0-1 loss with a convex surrogate so as to make empirical risk minimization computationally
  tractable. Previous work has uncovered sufficient and necessary conditions for the
  consistency of the resulting procedures. In this paper, we strengthen these results
  by showing how the 0-1 excess loss of a predictor can be upper bounded as a function
  of the excess loss of the predictor measured using the convex surrogate. The bound
  is developed for the case of cost-sensitive multiclass classification and a convex
  surrogate loss that goes back to the work of  Lee, Lin and Wahba. The bounds are
  as easy to calculate as in binary classification. Furthermore, we also show that
  our analysis extends to the analysis of the recently introduced “Simplex Coding”
  scheme.
