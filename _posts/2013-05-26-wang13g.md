title: Robust and Discriminative Self-Taught Learning
abstract: The lack of training data is a common challenge in many machine learning
  problems, which is often tackled by semi-supervised learning methods or transfer
  learning methods. The former requires unlabeled images from the same distribution
  as the labeled ones and the latter leverages labeled images from related homogenous
  tasks. However, these restrictions often cannot be satisfied. To address this, we
  propose a novel robust and discriminative self-taught learning approach to utilize
  any unlabeled data without the above restrictions. Our new approach employs a robust
  loss function to learn the dictionary, and enforces the structured sparse regularization
  to automatically select the optimal dictionary basis vectors and incorporate the
  supervision information contained in the labeled data. We derive an efficient iterative
  algorithm to solve the optimization problem and rigorously prove its convergence.
  Promising results in extensive experiments have validated the proposed approach.
