title: Optimization with First-Order Surrogate Functions
abstract: In this paper, we study optimization methods consisting of iteratively minimizing
  surrogates of an objective function. By proposing several algorithmic variants and
  simple convergence analyses, we make two main contributions.  First, we provide
  a unified viewpoint for several first-order optimization techniques such as accelerated
  proximal gradient, block coordinate descent, or Frank-Wolfe algorithms.  Second,
  we introduce a new incremental scheme that experimentally matches or outperforms
  state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale optimization problems typically arising
  in machine learning.
