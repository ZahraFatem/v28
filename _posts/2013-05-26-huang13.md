title: Spectral Learning of Hidden Markov Models from Dynamic and Static Data
abstract: We develop spectral learning algorithms for Hidden Markov Models  that learn
  not only from time series, or dynamic data but also  static data drawn independently
  from the HMMâ€™s stationary distribution.  This is motivated by the fact that static,
  orderless snapshots are usually easier to obtain than time series in quite a few
  dynamic modeling tasks. Building on existing spectral learning algorithms, our methods
  solve convex optimization problems minimizing squared loss on the dynamic data plus
  a regularization term on the static data. Experiments on synthetic and  real human
  activities data demonstrate better prediction by the proposed method than existing
  spectral algorithms.
