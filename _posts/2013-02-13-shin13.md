title: A New Frontier of Kernel Design for Structured Data
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'Many kernels for discretely structured data in the literature are designed
  within the framework of the convolution kernel and its generalization, the mapping
  kernel. The two most important advantages to use this framework is an easy-to-check
  criteria of positive definiteness and efficient computation based on the dynamic
  programming methodology of the resulting kernels.  On the other hand, the recent
  theory of partitionable kernels reveals that the known kernels only take advantage
  of a very small portion of the potential of the framework.  In fact, we have good
  opportunities to find novel and important kernels in the unexplored area.  In this
  paper, we shed light on a novel important class of kernels within the framework:
  We give a mathematical characterization of the class, show a parametric method to
  optimize kernels of the class to specific problems, based on this characterization,
  and present some experimental results, which show the new kernels are promising
  in both accuracy and efficiency.  '
