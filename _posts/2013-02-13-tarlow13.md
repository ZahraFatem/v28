title: Stochastic k-Neighborhood Selection for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
abstract: 'Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) is a popular method for  learning
  a distance metric to be used within a k-nearest neighbors  (kNN) classifier.    A
  key assumption built into the model is that each point  stochastically selects a
  single neighbor, which  makes the model well-justified only for kNN with k=1.  However,
  kNN classifiers with k>1 are more robust and usually   preferred in practice.     Here
  we present kNCA, which generalizes NCA by  learning distance metrics that are appropriate
  for  kNN with arbitrary k.  The main technical contribution is showing  how to efficiently
  compute and optimize the expected  accuracy of a kNN classifier.  We apply similar
  ideas in an unsupervised  setting to yield kSNE and ktSNE, generalizations of  Stochastic
  Neighbor Embedding (SNE, tSNE) that operate on  neighborhoods of size k, which provide
  an axis of control over  embeddings that allow for more homogeneous and interpretable
  regions.  Empirically, we show that kNCA often improves classification accuracy
  over  state of the art methods, produces qualitative  differences in the embeddings
  as k is varied, and is more robust with  respect to label noise. '
