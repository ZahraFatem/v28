title: 'Algebraic classifiers: a generic approach to fast cross-validation, online
  training, and parallel training'
abstract: We use abstract algebra to derive new algorithms for fast cross-validation,
  online learning, and parallel learning.  To use these algorithms on a classification
  model, we must show that the model has appropriate algebraic structure.  It is easy
  to give algebraic structure to some models, and we do this explicitly for Bayesian
  classifiers and a novel variation of decision stumps called HomStumps.  But not
  all classifiers have an obvious structure, so we introduce the Free HomTrainer.  This
  can be used to give a “generic” algebraic structure to any classifier.  We use the
  Free HomTrainer to give algebraic structure to bagging and boosting.  In so doing,
  we derive novel online and parallel algorithms, and present the first fast cross-validation
  schemes for these classifiers.
