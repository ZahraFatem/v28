title: Risk Bounds and Learning Algorithms for the Regression Approach to Structured
  Output Prediction
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'We provide rigorous guarantees for the regression approach to structured
  output prediction. We show that the quadratic regression loss is a convex surrogate
  of the prediction loss when the output kernel satisfies some condition with respect
  to the prediction loss. We provide two upper bounds of the prediction risk that
  depend on the empirical quadratic risk of the predictor. The minimizer of the first
  bound is the predictor proposed by Cortes et al. (2007) while the minimizer of the
  second bound is a predictor that  has never been proposed so far. Both predictors
  are compared on practical tasks.  '
