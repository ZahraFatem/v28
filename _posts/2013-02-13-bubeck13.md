title: Multiple Identifications in Multi-Armed Bandits
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: We study the problem of identifying the top m arms in a multi-armed bandit
  game. Our proposed solution relies on a new algorithm based on successive rejects
  of the seemingly bad arms, and successive accepts of the good ones. This algorithmic
  contribution allows to tackle other multiple identifications settings that were
  previously out of reach. In particular we show that this idea of successive accepts
  and rejects applies to the multi-bandit best arm identification problem.
