title: A Fast and Exact Energy Minimization Algorithm for Cycle MRFs
abstract: The presence of cycles gives rise to the difficulty in performing inference
  for MRFs. Handling cycles efficiently would greatly enhance our ability to tackle
  general MRFs. In particular, for dual decomposition of energy minimization (MAP
  inference), using cycle subproblems leads   to a much tighter relaxation than using
  trees, but solving the cycle subproblems turns out to be the bottleneck.  In this
  paper, we present a fast and exact algorithm for energy minimization in cycle MRFs,
  which can be used as a subroutine in tackling general MRFs. Our method builds on
  junction-tree message passing, with a large portion of the message entries pruned
  for efficiency. The pruning conditions fully exploit the structure of a cycle. Experimental
  results show that our algorithm is more than an order of magnitude faster than other
  state-of-the-art fast inference methods, and it performs consistently well in several
  different real problems.
