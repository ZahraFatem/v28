title: On the Generalization Ability of Online Learning Algorithms for Pairwise Loss
  Functions
abstract: In this paper, we study the generalization properties of online learning
  based stochastic methods for supervised learning problems where the loss function
  is dependent on more than one training sample (e.g., metric learning, ranking).
  We present a generic decoupling technique that enables us to provide Rademacher
  complexity-based generalization error bounds. Our bounds are in general tighter
  than those obtained by Wang et al. (COLT 2012) for the same problem. Using our decoupling
  technique, we are further able to obtain fast convergence rates for strongly con-vex
  pairwise loss functions. We are also able to analyze a class of memory efficient
  on-line learning algorithms for pairwise learning problems that use only a bounded
  subset of past training samples to update the hypothesis at each step. Finally,
  in order to complement our generalization bounds, we propose a novel memory efficient
  online learning algorithm for higher order learning problems with bounded regret
  guarantees.
