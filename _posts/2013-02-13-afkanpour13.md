title: A Randomized Mirror Descent Algorithm for Large Scale Multiple Kernel Learning
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: We consider the problem of simultaneously learning to linearly combine a
  very large number of kernels and learn a good predictor based on the learnt kernel.
  When the number of kernels d to be combined is very large, multiple kernel learning
  methods whose computational cost scales linearly in d are intractable. We propose
  a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to overcome this issue, under
  the objective of minimizing the group p-norm penalized empirical risk. The key to
  achieve the required exponential speed-up is the computationally efficient construction
  of low-variance estimates of the gradient. We propose importance sampling based
  estimates, and find that the ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability
  proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show that in the
  case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial structure
  of the base kernels to be combined allows sampling from this distribution in O(\log(d))
  time, making the total computational cost of the method to achieve an epsilon-optimal
  solution to be O(\log(d)/epsilon^2), thereby allowing our method to operate for
  very large values of d. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the
  new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art alternatives.
