title: Selective sampling algorithms for cost-sensitive multiclass prediction
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of active learning for cost-sensitive
  multiclass classification. We propose selective  sampling algorithms, which process
  the data in a streaming fashion,  querying only a subset of the labels. For these
  algorithms, we analyze the regret and label complexity when the labels are generated
  according to a generalized linear model. We establish that the gains of active learning
  over passive learning can range from none to exponentially large, based on a natural
  notion of margin. We also  present a safety guarantee to guard against model mismatch.
  Numerical  simulations show that our algorithms indeed obtain a low regret with
  a  small number of queries.
