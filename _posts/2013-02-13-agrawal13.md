title: Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoffs
abstract: 'Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit
  problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently
  generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better
  empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. However, many questions
  regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and
  analyze Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit
  problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive
  adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied version of the contextual
  bandits problem. We prove a high probability regret bound of \tildeO(\fracd\sqrtε\sqrtT^1+ε)
  in time T for any ε∈(0,1), where d is the dimension of each context vector and εis
  a parameter used by the algorithm. Our results provide the first theoretical guarantees
  for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling, and are close to the lower bound
  of Ω(\sqrtdT) for this problem. This essentially solves the COLT open problem of
  Chapelle and Li [COLT 2012] regarding regret bounds for Thompson Sampling for contextual
  bandits problem with linear payoff functions.     Our version of Thompson sampling
  uses Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood function. Our novel martingale-based
  analysis techniques also allow easy extensions to the use of other distributions,
  satisfying certain general conditions.   '
