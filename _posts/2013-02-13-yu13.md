title: Characterizing the Representer Theorem
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: The representer theorem assures that kernel methods retain optimality under
  penalized empirical risk minimization. While a sufficient condition on the form
  of the regularizer guaranteeing the representer theorem has been known since the
  initial development of kernel methods, necessary conditions have only been investigated
  recently. In this paper we completely characterize the necessary and sufficient
  conditions on the regularizer that ensure the representer theorem holds. The results
  are surprisingly simple yet broaden the conditions where the representer theorem
  is known to hold. Extension to the matrix domain is also addressed.
