title: Scalable Optimization of Neighbor Embedding for Visualization
abstract: Neighbor embedding (NE) methods have found their use in data visualization
  but are limited in big data analysis tasks due to their O(n^2) complexity for n
  data samples. We demonstrate that the obvious approach of subsampling produces inferior
  results and propose a generic approximated optimization technique that reduces the
  NE optimization cost to O(n log n). The technique is based on realizing that in
  visualization the embedding space is necessarily very low-dimensional (2D or 3D),
  and hence efficient approximations developed for n-body force calculations can be
  applied. In gradient-based NE algorithms the gradient for an individual point decomposes
  into “forces” exerted by the other points. The contributions of close-by points
  need to be computed individually but far-away points can be approximated by their
  “center of mass”, rapidly computable by applying a recursive decomposition of the
  visualization space into quadrants. The new algorithm brings a significant speed-up
  for medium-size data, and brings “big data” within reach of visualization.
