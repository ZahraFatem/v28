title: Near-Optimal Bounds for Cross-Validation via Loss Stability
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Multi-fold cross-validation is an established practice to estimate the error
  rate   of a learning algorithm.  Quantifying the variance reduction gains due to
  cross-validation   has been challenging due to the inherent correlations introduced
  by the folds.    In this work we introduce a new and weak measure of stability called
  \emphloss stability  and relate the cross-validation performance to loss stability;
  we also establish that this   relationship is near-optimal.  Our work thus quantitatively
  improves the current  best bounds on cross-validation.
