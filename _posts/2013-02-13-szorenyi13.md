title: Gossip-based distributed stochastic bandit algorithms
abstract: 'The multi-armed bandit problem has attracted remarkable attention in the
  machine learning community and many efficient algorithms have been proposed to handle
  the so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma in various bandit setups. At the
  same time, significantly less effort has been devoted to adapting bandit algorithms
  to particular architectures, such as sensor networks, multi-core machines, or peer-to-peer
  (P2P) environments, which could potentially speed up their convergence. Our goal
  is to adapt stochastic bandit algorithms to P2P networks.  In our setup, the same
  set of arms is available in each peer. In every iteration each peer can pull one
  arm independently of the other peers, and then some limited communication is possible
  with a few random other peers.  As our main result, we show that our adaptation
  achieves a linear speedup in terms of the number of peers participating in the network.  More
  precisely, we show that the probability of playing a suboptimal arm at a peer in
  iteration t = Î©( \log N ) is proportional to 1/(Nt) where N denotes the number of
  peers.  The theoretical results are supported by simulation experiments showing
  that our algorithm scales gracefully with the size of network.  '
