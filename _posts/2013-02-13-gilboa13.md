title: Scaling Multidimensional Gaussian Processes using Projected Additive Approximations
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Exact Gaussian Process (GP) regression has O(N^3) runtime for data size
  N, making it intractable for large N. Advances in GP scaling have not been extended
  to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional
  applications.   This paper introduces and tests a novel method of projected additive
  approximation to multidimensional GPs. We thoroughly illustrate the power of this
  method on several datasets, achieving close performance to the naive Full GP at
  orders of magnitude less cost.
