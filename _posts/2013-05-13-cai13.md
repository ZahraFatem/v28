title: 'SADA: A General Framework to Support Robust Causation Discovery'
abstract: Causality discovery without manipulation is considered a crucial problem
  to a variety of applications, such as genetic therapy. The state-of-the-art solutions,
  e.g. LiNGAM, return accurate results when the number of labeled samples is larger
  than the number of variables. These approaches are thus applicable only when large
  numbers of samples are available or the problem domain is sufficiently small. Motivated
  by the observations of the local sparsity properties on causal structures, we propose
  a general Split-and-Merge strategy, named SADA, to enhance the scalability of a
  wide class of causality discovery algorithms. SADA is able to accurately identify
  the causal variables, even when the sample size is significantly smaller than the
  number of variables. In SADA, the variables are partitioned into subsets, by finding
  cuts on the sparse probabilistic graphical model over the variables. By running
  mainstream causation discovery algorithms, e.g. LiNGAM, on the subproblems, complete
  causality can be reconstructed by combining all the partial results. SADA benefits
  from the recursive division technique, since each small subproblem generates more
  accurate result under the same number of samples. We theoretically prove that SADA
  always reduces the scale of problems without significant sacrifice on result accuracy,
  depending only on the local sparsity condition over the variables. Experiments on
  real-world datasets verify the improvements on scalability and accuracy by applying
  SADA on top of existing causation algorithms.
