title: Enhanced statistical rankings  via  targeted data collection
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'Given a graph where vertices represent alternatives and pairwise comparison
  data, y_ij, is given on the edges, the statistical ranking problem is to find a
  potential function, defined on the vertices, such that the gradient of the potential
  function agrees with pairwise comparisons. We study the dependence of the statistical
  ranking problem on the available pairwise data, i.e., pairs (i,j) for which the
  pairwise comparison data y_ij is known, and propose a framework to identify data
  which, when augmented with the current dataset, maximally increases the Fisher information
  of the ranking. Under certain assumptions, the data collection problem decouples,
  reducing to a problem of finding an edge set on the graph (with a fixed number of
  edges) such that the  second eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is maximal. This
  reduction of the data collection problem to a spectral graph-theoretic question
  is one of the primary contributions of this work. As an application, we study the
  Yahoo! Movie user rating dataset and demonstrate that the addition of a small number
  of well-chosen pairwise comparisons can significantly increase the Fisher informativeness
  of the ranking. '
