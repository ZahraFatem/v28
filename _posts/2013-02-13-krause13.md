title: Approximation properties of DBNs with binary hidden units and real-valued visible
  units
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Deep belief networks (DBNs) can approximate any distribution over fixed-length
  binary vectors. However, DBNs are frequently applied to model real-valued data,
  and so far little is known about their representational power in this case.  We
  analyze the approximation properties of DBNs with two layers of binary hidden units
  and visible units with conditional distributions from the exponential family. It
  is shown that these DBNs can, under mild assumptions, model any additive mixture
  of distributions from the exponential family with independent variables. An arbitrarily
  good approximation in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence of an m-dimensional mixture
  distribution with n components can be achieved by a DBN with m visible variables
  and n and n+1 hidden variables in the first and second hidden layer, respectively.
  Furthermore, relevant infinite mixtures can be approximated arbitrarily well by
  a DBN with a finite number of neurons. This includes the important special case
  of an infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions with fixed variance restricted
  to a compact domain, which in turn can approximate any strictly positive density
  over this domain.
