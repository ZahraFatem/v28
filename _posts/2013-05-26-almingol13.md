title: Learning Multiple Behaviors from Unlabeled Demonstrations in a Latent Controller
  Space
abstract: 'In this paper we introduce a method to learn multiple behaviors in the
  form of motor primitives from an unlabeled dataset. One of the difficulties of this
  problem is that in the measurement space, behaviors can be very mixed, despite existing
  a latent representation where they can be easily separated.  We propose a mixture
  model based on Dirichlet Process (DP) to simultaneously cluster the observed time-series
  and recover a sparse representation of the behaviors using a Laplacian prior as
  the base measure of the DP. We show that for linear models, e.g potential functions
  generated by linear combinations of a large number of features, it is possible to
  compute analytically the marginal of the observations and derive an efficient sampler.
  The method is evaluated using robot behaviors and real data from human motion and
  compared to other techniques.  '
