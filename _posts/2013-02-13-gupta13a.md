title: 'Factorial Multi-Task Learning : A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach'
abstract: Multi-task learning is a paradigm shown to improve the performance of related
  tasks through their joint learning. However, for real-world data, it is usually
  difficult to assess the task relatedness and joint learning with unrelated tasks
  may lead to serious performance degradations. To this end, we propose a framework
  that groups the tasks based on their relatedness in a low dimensional subspace and
  allows a varying degree of relatedness among tasks by sharing the subspace bases
  across the groups. This provides the flexibility of no sharing when two sets of
  tasks are unrelated and partial/total sharing when the tasks are related. Importantly,
  the number of task-groups and the subspace dimensionality are automatically inferred
  from the data. This feature keeps the model beyond a specific set of parameters.
  To realize our framework, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior that extends
  the traditional hierarchical beta process prior using a Dirichlet process to permit
  potentially infinite number of child beta processes. We apply our model for multi-task
  regression and classification applications. Experimental results using several synthetic
  and real-world datasets show the superiority of our model to other recent state-of-the-art
  multi-task learning methods.
