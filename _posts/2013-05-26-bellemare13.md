title: Bayesian Learning of Recursively Factored Environments
abstract: 'Model-based reinforcement learning techniques have historically encountered
  a number of difficulties scaling up to large observation spaces. One promising approach
  has been to decompose the model learning task into a number of smaller, more manageable
  sub-problems by factoring the observation space. Typically, many different factorizations
  are possible, which can make it difficult to select an appropriate factorization
  without extensive testing. In this paper we introduce the class of recursively decomposable
  factorizations, and show how exact Bayesian inference can be used to efficiently
  guarantee predictive performance close to the best factorization in this class.
  We demonstrate the strength of this approach by presenting a collection of empirical
  results for 20 different Atari 2600 games.  '
