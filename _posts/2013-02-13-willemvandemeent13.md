title: Hierarchically-coupled hidden {M}arkov models for learning kinetic rates from
  single-molecule data
abstract: We address the problem of analyzing sets of noisy time-varying signals that
  all report on the same process but confound straightforward analyses due to complex
  inter-signal heterogeneities and measurement artifacts.  In particular we consider
  single-molecule experiments which indirectly measure the distinct steps in a biomolecular
  process via observations of noisy time-dependent signals such as a fluorescence
  intensity or bead position. Straightforward hidden Markov model (HMM) analyses attempt
  to characterize such processes in terms of a set of conformational states, the transitions
  that can occur between these states, and the associated rates at which those transitions
  occur; but require ad-hoc post-processing steps to combine multiple signals.  Here
  we develop a hierarchically coupled HMM that allows experimentalists to deal with
  inter-signal variability in a principled and automatic way. Our approach is a generalized
  expectation maximization hyperparameter point estimation procedure with variational
  Bayes at the level of individual time series that learns an single interpretable
  representation of the overall data generating process.
