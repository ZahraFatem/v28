title: Local Deep Kernel Learning for Efficient Non-linear SVM Prediction
abstract: Our objective is to speed up non-linear SVM prediction while maintaining
  classification accuracy above an acceptable limit. We generalize Localized Multiple
  Kernel Learning so as to learn a primal feature space embedding which is high dimensional,
  sparse and computationally deep. Primal based classification decouples prediction
  costs from the number of support vectors and our tree-structured features efficiently
  encode non-linearities while speeding up prediction exponentially over the state-of-the-art.
  We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree-structured features and
  efficiently scale to problems with over half a million training points. Experiments
  on benchmark data sets reveal that our formulation can reduce prediction costs by
  more than three orders of magnitude in some cases with a moderate sacrifice in classification
  accuracy as compared to RBF-SVMs. Furthermore, our formulation leads to much better
  classification accuracies over leading methods.
