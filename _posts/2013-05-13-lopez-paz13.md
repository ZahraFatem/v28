title: Gaussian Process Vine Copulas for Multivariate Dependence
abstract: Copulas allow to learn marginal distributions separately from the multivariate
  dependence structure (copula) that links them together into a density function.  Vine
  factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing a hierarchy
  of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference, it is common to
  assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent from its
  conditioning variables.  In this paper, we relax this assumption by discovering
  the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning
  variables.  We learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse
  Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for scalable, approximate inference.
  Experiments on real-world datasets show that, when modeling all conditional dependencies,
  we obtain better estimates of the underlying copula of the data.
