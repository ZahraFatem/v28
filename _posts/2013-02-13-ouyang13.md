title: Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has received lots
  of attention recently due to the tremendous demand from large-scale and data-distributed
  machine learning applications. In this paper, we present a stochastic setting for
  optimization problems with non-smooth composite objective functions. To solve this
  problem, we propose a stochastic ADMM algorithm. Our algorithm applies to a more
  general class of convex and nonsmooth objective functions, beyond the smooth and
  separable least squares loss used in lasso. We also demonstrate the rates of convergence
  for our algorithm under various structural assumptions of the stochastic function:
  O(1/\sqrtt) for convex functions and O(\log t/t) for strongly convex functions.
  Compared to previous literature, we establish the convergence rate of ADMM for convex
  problems in terms of both the objective value and the feasibility violation. A novel
  application named Graph-Guided SVM is proposed to demonstrate the usefulness of
  our algorithm.'
