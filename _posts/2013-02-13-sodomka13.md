title: 'Coco-Q: Learning in Stochastic Games with Side Payments'
abstract: Coco (""cooperative/competitive"") values are a solution concept for two-player
  normal-form games with transferable utility, when binding agreements and side payments
  between players are possible. In this paper, we show that coco values can also be
  defined for stochastic games and can be learned using a simple variant of Q-learning
  that is provably convergent. We provide a set of examples showing how the strategies
  learned by the Coco-Q algorithm relate to those learned by existing multiagent Q-learning
  algorithms.
