title: Inference algorithms for pattern-based CRFs on sequence data
abstract: 'We consider \em Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with pattern-based potentials  defined
  on a chain. In this model the energy of a string (labeling) x_1\ldots x_n  is the
  sum of terms over intervals [i,j] where each term is non-zero only if the substring
  x_i\ldots x_j  equals a prespecified pattern α. Such CRFs can be naturally applied
  to many sequence tagging problems. We present efficient algorithms for the three
  standard inference tasks in a CRF, namely  computing (i) the partition function,
  (ii) marginals, and (iii) computing the MAP.  Their complexities are respectively  O(n
  L), O(n L \ell_\max) and  O(n L \min{|D|,\log (\ell_\max + 1)})  where L is the
  combined length of input patterns, \ell_\max is the maximum length of a pattern,  and
  D is the input alphabet.  This improves on the previous algorithms of \citeYe:NIPS09
  whose complexities are respectively O(n L |D|),  O\left(n |Γ| L^2 \ell_\max^2\right)
  and O(n L |D|),  where |Γ| is the number of input patterns. In addition, we give
  an efficient algorithm for sampling,  and revisit the case of MAP with non-positive
  weights. Finally, we apply pattern-based CRFs to the problem of the protein dihedral
  angles prediction.  '
