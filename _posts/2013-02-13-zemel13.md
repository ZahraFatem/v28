title: Learning Fair Representations
abstract: 'We propose a learning algorithm for fair classification that achieves both
  group fairness (the proportion of members in a protected group receiving positive
  classification is identical to the proportion in the population as a  whole), and
  individual fairness (similar individuals should be treated similarly).  We formulate
  fairness as an optimization problem of finding a  good representation of the data
  with two competing goals: to encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously
  obfuscating any information about membership in the protected group.  We show positive
  results of our algorithm relative to other known techniques, on three datasets.  Moreover,
  we demonstrate several advantages to our approach.  First, our intermediate representation
  can be used for other classification tasks (i.e., transfer  learning is possible);
  secondly, we take a step toward learning a distance metric which can find important
  dimensions of the data for classification.'
