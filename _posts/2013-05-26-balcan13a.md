title: Exploiting Ontology Structures and Unlabeled Data for Learning
abstract: We present and analyze a theoretical model designed to understand and  explain
  the effectiveness of ontologies for learning multiple related  tasks from primarily
  unlabeled data.  We present both  information-theoretic results as well as efficient
  algorithms.    We show in this model that an ontology, which specifies the  relationships
  between multiple outputs, in some cases is sufficient  to completely learn a classification
  using a large unlabeled data  source.
