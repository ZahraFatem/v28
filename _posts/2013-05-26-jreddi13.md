title: Scale Invariant Conditional Dependence Measures
abstract: In this paper we develop new dependence and conditional dependence measures
  and provide their estimators. An attractive property of these measures and estimators
  is that they are invariant to any monotone increasing transformations of the random
  variables, which is important in many applications including feature selection.
  Under certain conditions we show the consistency of these estimators, derive upper
  bounds on their convergence rates, and show that the estimators do not suffer from
  the curse of dimensionality. However, when the conditions are less restrictive,
  we derive a lower bound which proves that in the worst case the convergence can
  be arbitrarily slow similarly to some other estimators. Numerical illustrations
  demonstrate the applicability of our method.
