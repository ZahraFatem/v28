title: Robust Structural Metric Learning
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: Metric learning algorithms produce a linear transformation of data which
  is optimized for a prediction task, such as nearest-neighbor classification or ranking.  However,
  when the input data contains a large portion of non-informative features, existing
  methods fail to identify the relevant features, and performance degrades accordingly.
  In this paper, we present an efficient and robust structural metric learning algorithm
  which enforces group sparsity on the learned transformation, while optimizing for
  structured ranking output prediction.  Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
  demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods in both high-
  and low-noise settings.
