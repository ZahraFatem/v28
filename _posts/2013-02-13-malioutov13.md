title: Exact Rule Learning via Boolean Compressed Sensing
abstract: 'We propose an interpretable rule-based classification system based on ideas
  from Boolean compressed sensing. We represent the problem of learning individual
  conjunctive clauses or individual disjunctive clauses as a Boolean group testing
  problem, and apply a novel linear programming relaxation to find solutions. We derive
  results for exact rule recovery which parallel the conditions for exact recovery
  of sparse signals in the compressed sensing literature: although the general rule
  recovery problem is NP-hard, under some conditions on the Boolean ‘sensing’ matrix,
  the rule can be recovered exactly. This is an exciting development in rule learning
  where most prior work focused on heuristic solutions. Furthermore we construct rule
  sets from these learned clauses using set covering and boosting.  We show competitive
  classification accuracy using the proposed approach.'
