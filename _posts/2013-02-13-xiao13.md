title: Domain Adaptation for Sequence Labeling Tasks with a Probabilistic Language
  Adaptation Model
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose to address the problem of domain adaptation for
  sequence labeling tasks via distributed representation learning by using a log-bilinear
  language adaptation model. The proposed neural probabilistic language model simultaneously
  models two different but related data distributions in the source and target domains   based
  on induced distributed representations, which encode both generalizable and domain-specific
  latent features. We then use the learned dense real-valued representation as   augmenting
  features for natural language processing systems. We empirically evaluate the proposed
  learning technique on WSJ and MEDLINE domains with POS tagging systems, and on WSJ
  and Brown corpora with syntactic chunking and name entity recognition systems. Our
  primary results show that the proposed domain adaptation method outperforms a number
  comparison methods for cross domain sequence labeling tasks. '
