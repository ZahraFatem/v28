title: 'Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit: General Framework and Applications'
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed
  bandit (CMAB) problems, where simple arms with unknown istributions  form \em super
  arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the outcomes of its related simple
  arms are observed, which helps the selection of super arms in future rounds. The
  reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of played arms, and it only needs
  to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances.
  We assume the availability of an (α,β)-approximation oracle that takes the  means
  of the distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability βgenerates  an
  αfraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of a CMAB algorithm is to
  minimize \em (α,β)-approximation regret, which is the difference in total expected
  reward between the αβfraction of expected reward when always playing the optimal
  super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm.
  We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(\log n) regret, where n is the number
  of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large
  class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound
  for classical MAB problem up to a constant factor, and it significantly improves
  the regret bound in a recent paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards.
  We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage
  (PMC) for online advertising and social influence maximization for viral marketing,
  both having nonlinear reward structures.
