title: Approximate Inference in Collective Graphical Models
abstract: 'We study the problem of approximate inference in collective graphical models
  (CGMs), which were recently introduced to model the problem of learning and inference
  with noisy aggregate observations. We first analyze the complexity of inference
  in CGMs: unlike inference in conventional graphical models, exact inference in CGMs
  is NP-hard even for tree-structured models. We then develop a tractable convex approximation
  to the NP-hard MAP inference problem in CGMs, and show how to use MAP inference
  for approximate marginal inference within the EM framework. We demonstrate empirically
  that these approximation techniques can reduce the computational cost of inference
  by two orders of magnitude and the cost of learning by at least an order of magnitude
  while providing solutions of equal or better quality.'
