title: Breaking the Small Cluster Barrier of Graph Clustering
abstract: 'This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in
  the   presence of  \em small clusters. Traditional results dictate that for an   algorithm
  to provably correctly recover the clusters, \em all clusters must be   sufficiently
  large (in particular, \tildeΩ(\sqrtn) where n is the number   of nodes of the graph).
  We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined   analysis of the
  trace-norm based matrix recovery approach proposed in (Jalali et al. 2011) and (Chen
  et al. 2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assuptions, do not
  hinder recovery of large ones.  Based on this result, we further devise an iterative
  algorithm   to recover \em almost all clusters via a “peeling strategy”, i.e., recover
  large clusters   first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure.   These
  results are extended to the    \em partial observation setting, in which only a
  (chosen) part of the graph is observed.  The peeling strategy gives rise to an active
  learning algorithm, in which   edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more
  often as large clusters are learned  (and removed).  Our findings are supported
  by experiments.    From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimesional
  statistics and   learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning
  problem for which  a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but
  a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations  does the job.'
