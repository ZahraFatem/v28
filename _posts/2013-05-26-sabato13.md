title: Feature Multi-Selection among Subjective Features
abstract: When dealing with subjective, noisy, or otherwise nebulous features, the
  “wisdom of crowds” suggests that one may benefit from multiple judgments of the
  same feature on the same object. We give theoretically-motivated ""feature multi-selection""
  algorithms that choose, among a large set of candidate features, not only which
  features to judge but how many times to judge each one. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of this approach for linear regression on a crowdsourced learning task of predicting
  people’s height and weight from photos, using features such as ""gender"" and  ""estimated
  weight"" as well as culturally fraught ones such as ""attractive"".
