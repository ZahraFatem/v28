title: Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe Optimization for Structural SVMs
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: We propose a randomized block-coordinate variant of the classic Frank-Wolfe
  algorithm for convex optimization with block-separable constraints. Despite its
  lower iteration cost, we show that it achieves a similar convergence rate in duality
  gap as the full Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We also show that, when applied to the dual
  structural support vector machine (SVM) objective, this yields an online algorithm
  that has the same low iteration complexity as primal stochastic subgradient methods.
  However, unlike stochastic subgradient methods, the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe
  algorithm allows us to compute the optimal step-size and yields a computable duality
  gap guarantee. Our experiments indicate that this simple algorithm outperforms competing
  structural SVM solvers.
