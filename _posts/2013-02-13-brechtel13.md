title: 'Solving Continuous POMDPs: Value Iteration with Incremental Learning of an
  Efficient Space Representation'
abstract: Discrete POMDPs of medium complexity can be approximately solved in reasonable
  time. However, most applications have a continuous and thus uncountably infinite
  state space. We propose the novel concept of learning a discrete representation
  of the continuous state space to solve the integrals in continuous POMDPs efficiently
  and generalize sparse calculations over the continuous space. The representation
  is iteratively refined as part of a novel Value Iteration step and does not depend
  on prior knowledge. Consistency for the learned generalization is asserted by a
  self-correction algorithm. The presented concept is implemented for continuous state
  and observation spaces based on Monte Carlo approximation to allow for arbitrary
  POMDP models. In an experimental comparison it yields higher values in significantly
  shorter time than state of the art algorithms and solves higher-dimensional problems.
