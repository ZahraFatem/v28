title: 'Revisiting Frank-Wolfe: Projection-Free Sparse Convex Optimization'
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for
  Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex
  optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis
  also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if
  the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity
  of the obtained solutions.    On the application side, this allows us to unify a
  large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization
  over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated,
  including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices,
  permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general
  framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe
  iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas
  of this approach.
