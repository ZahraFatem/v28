title: Forecastable Component Analysis
abstract: "I introduce Forecastable Component Analysis (ForeCA), a novel dimension
  reduction technique for temporally dependent signals. Based on a new forecastability
  measure, ForeCA finds an optimal transformation to separate a multivariate time
  series into a forecastable and an orthogonal white noise space. I present a converging
  algorithm with a fast eigenvector solution. Applications to financial and macro-economic
  time series show that ForeCA can successfully discover informative structure, which
  can be used for forecasting as well as classification. The R package ForeCA accompanies
  this work and is publicly available on CRAN."
