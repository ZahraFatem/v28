title: Efficient Semi-supervised and Active Learning of Disjunctions
number: 1
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'We provide efficient algorithms for learning disjunctions in the semi-supervised
  setting under a natural regularity assumption introduced by (Balcan & Blum, 2005).
  We prove bounds on the sample complexity of our algorithms under a mild restriction
  on the data distribution. We also give an active learning algorithm with improved
  sample complexity and extend all our algorithms to the random classification noise
  setting.  '
