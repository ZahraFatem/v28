title: Sharp Generalization Error Bounds for Randomly-projected Classifiers
abstract: 'We derive sharp bounds on the generalization error of a generic linear
  classifier trained by   empirical risk minimization on randomly-projected data.
  We make no restrictive assumptions   (such as sparsity or separability) on the data:
  Instead we use the fact that, in a classification setting, the question of interest
  is really ‘what is the effect of random projection on the predicted class labels?’
  and we therefore derive the exact probability of ‘label flipping’ under Gaussian
  random projection in order to quantify this effect precisely in our bounds.'
