title: The Pairwise Piecewise-Linear Embedding for Efficient Non-Linear Classification
number: 0
section: cycle-1
abstract: Linear classiffers are much faster to learn and test than non-linear ones.
  On the other hand, non-linear kernels offer improved performance, albeit at the
  increased cost of training kernel classiffers. To use non-linear mappings with efficient
  linear learning algorithms, explicit embeddings that approximate popular kernels
  have recently been proposed. However, the embedding process itself is often costly
  and the results are usually less accurate than kernel methods. In this work we propose
  a non-linear feature map that is both very efficient, but at the same time highly
  expressive. The method is based on discretization and interpolation of individual
  features values and feature pairs. The discretization allows us to model different
  regions of the feature space separately, while the interpolation preserves the original
  continuous values. Using this embedding is strictly more general than a linear model
  and as efficient as the second-order polynomial explicit feature map. An extensive
  empirical evaluation shows that our method consistently signiffcantly outperforms
  other methods, including a wide range of kernels. This is in contrast to other proposed
  embeddings that were faster than kernel methods, but with lower accuracy.
