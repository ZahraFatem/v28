title: Mean Reversion with a Variance Threshold
abstract: Starting from a multivariate data set, we study several techniques to isolate
  affine combinations of the variables with a maximum amount of mean reversion, while
  constraining the variance to be larger than a given threshold. We show that many
  of the optimization problems arising in this context can be solved exactly using
  semidefinite programming and some variant of the \mathcalS-lemma. In finance, these
  methods are used to isolate statistical arbitrage opportunities, i.e. mean reverting
  portfolios with enough variance to overcome market friction. In a more general setting,
  mean reversion and its generalizations are also used as a proxy for stationarity,
  while variance simply measures signal strength.
