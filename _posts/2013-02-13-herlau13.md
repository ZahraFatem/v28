title: Modeling Temporal Evolution and Multiscale Structure in Networks
abstract: 'Many real-world networks exhibit both temporal evolution and multiscale
  structure.  We propose a model for temporally correlated multifurcating hierarchies
  in complex networks which jointly capture both effects. We use the Gibbs fragmentation
  tree as prior over multifurcating trees and a change-point model to account for
  the temporal evolution of each vertex.  We demonstrate that our model is able to
  infer time-varying multiscale structure in synthetic as well as three real world
  time-evolving complex networks.  Our modeling of the temporal evolution of hierarchies
  brings new insights into the changing roles and position of entities and possibilities
  for better understanding these dynamic complex systems.  '
