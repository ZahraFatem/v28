title: Learning Connections in Financial Time Series
abstract: To reduce risk, investors seek assets that have high expected return and
  are unlikely to move in tandem. Correlation measures are generally used to quantify
  the connections between equities. The 2008 financial crisis, and its aftermath,
  demonstrated the need for a better way to quantify these connections. We present
  a machine learning-based method to build a connectedness matrix to address the shortcomings
  of correlation in capturing events such as large losses. Our method uses an unconstrained
  optimization to learn this matrix, while ensuring that the resulting matrix is positive
  semi-definite. We show that this matrix can be used to build portfolios that not
  only “beat the market,”  but also outperform optimal (i.e., minimum variance) portfolios.
