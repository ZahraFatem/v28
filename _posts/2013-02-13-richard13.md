title: Intersecting singularities for multi-structured estimation
abstract: We address the problem of designing a convex nonsmooth regularizer encouraging
  multiple structural effects simultaneously. Focusing on the inference of sparse
  and low-rank matrices we suggest a new complexity index and a convex penalty approximating
  it. The new penalty term can be written as the trace norm of a linear function of
  the matrix. By analyzing theoretical properties of this family of regularizers  we
  come up with oracle inequalities and compressed sensing results ensuring the quality
  of our regularized estimator. We also provide algorithms and supporting numerical
  experiments.
