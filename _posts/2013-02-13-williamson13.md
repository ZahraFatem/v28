title: Parallel {M}arkov Chain {M}onte {C}arlo for Nonparametric Mixture Models
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant
  alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown,
  but inference in such models can be slow. Existing attempts to parallelize inference
  in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies
  in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations
  for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to
  perform MCMC using the correct equilibrium distribution, in a distributed manner.
  We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in
  estimate quality that accompanies existing methods.
