title: Smooth Operators
abstract: We develop a generic approach to form smooth versions of basic mathematical
  operations like multiplication, composition, change of measure, and conditional
  expectation, among others.   Operations which result in functions outside the reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space (such as the product of two RKHS functions) are approximated
  via a natural cost function, such that the solution is guaranteed to be in the targeted
  RKHS. This approximation problem is reduced to a regression problem using an adjoint
  trick, and solved in a vector-valued RKHS, consisting of continuous, linear, smooth
  operators which map from an input, real-valued RKHS to the desired target RKHS.
  Important constraints, such as an almost everywhere positive density, can be enforced
  or approximated naturally in this framework, using convex constraints on the operators.
  Finally, smooth operators can be composed to accomplish more complex machine learning
  tasks, such as the sum rule and kernelized approximate Bayesian inference, where
  state-of-the-art convergence rates are obtained.
