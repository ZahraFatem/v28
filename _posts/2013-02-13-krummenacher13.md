title: Ellipsoidal Multiple Instance Learning
abstract: 'We propose a large margin method for asymmetric learning with ellipsoids,
  called eMIL, suited to multiple instance learning (MIL). We derive the distance
  between ellipsoids and the hyperplane, generalising the standard support vector
  machine. Negative bags in MIL contain only negative instances, and we treat them
  akin to uncertain observations in the robust optimisation framework. However, our
  method allows positive bags to cross the margin, since it is not known which instances
  within are positive.  We show that representing bags as ellipsoids under the introduced
  distance is the most robust solution when treating a bag as a random variable with
  finite mean and covariance. Two algorithms are derived to solve the resulting non-convex
  optimization problem: a concave-convex procedure and a quasi-Newton method. Our
  method achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets. We introduce a MIL dataset
  from a real world application of detecting wheel defects from multiple partial observations,
  and show that eMIL outperforms competing approaches.'
