title: Multi-Task Learning with Gaussian Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian Model
abstract: In this paper, we study the multi-task learning problem with a new perspective
  of considering the structure of the residue error matrix and the low-rank approximation
  to the task covariance matrix simultaneously. In particular, we first introduce
  the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian (MGIG) prior and define a Gaussian Matrix
  Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GMGIG) model for low-rank approximation to the task
  covariance matrix. Through combining the GMGIG model with the residual error structure
  assumption, we propose the GMGIG regression model for multi-task learning. To make
  the computation tractable, we simultaneously use variational inference and sampling
  techniques. In particular, we propose two sampling strategies for computing the
  statistics of the MGIG distribution. Experiments show that this model is superior
  to the peer methods in regression and prediction.
