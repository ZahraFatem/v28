title: Robust Regression on MapReduce
abstract: 'Although the MapReduce framework is now the \emphde facto standard for   analyzing
  massive data sets, many algorithms (in particular, many   iterative algorithms popular
  in machine learning, optimization, and linear   algebra) are hard to fit into MapReduce.   Consider,
  \emphe.g., the \ell_p regression problem: given a matrix   A ∈\mathbbR^m \times
  n and a vector b ∈\mathbbR^m, find a   vector x^* ∈\mathbbR^n that minimizes f(x)
  = \|A x - b\|_p.   The widely-used \ell_2 regression, \emphi.e., linear least-squares,
  is   known to be highly sensitive to outliers; and choosing p ∈[1, 2) can   help
  improve robustness.  In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving
  strongly   over-determined (m ≫n) robust \ell_p regression problems to moderate
  precision on   MapReduce.  Our empirical results on data up to the terabyte scale
  demonstrate   that our algorithm is a significant improvement over traditional iterative
  algorithms on MapReduce   for \ell_1 regression, even for a fairly small number   of
  iterations.   In addition, our proposed interior-point cutting-plane method can
  also be   extended to solving more general convex problems on MapReduce.'
