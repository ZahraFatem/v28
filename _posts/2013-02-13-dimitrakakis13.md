title: ABC Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'We introduce a simple, general framework for likelihood-free Bayesian reinforcement
  learning, through Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). The advantage is that
  we only require a prior distribution on a class of simulators. This is useful when
  a probabilistic model of the underlying process is too complex to formulate, but
  where detailed simulation models are available. ABC-RL allows  the use of any Bayesian
  reinforcement learning technique in this case. It can be seen as an extension of
  simulation methods to both planning and inference.  We experimentally demonstrate
  the potential of this approach in a comparison with LSPI. Finally, we introduce
  a theorem showing that ABC is sound.  '
