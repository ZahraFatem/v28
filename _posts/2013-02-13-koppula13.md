title: Learning Spatio-Temporal Structure from RGB-D Videos for Human Activity Detection
  and Anticipation
abstract: We consider the problem of detecting past activities as well as anticipating
  which activity will happen in the future and how. We start by modeling the rich
  spatio-temporal relations between human poses and objects (called affordances) using
  a conditional random field (CRF). However, because of the ambiguity in the temporal
  segmentation of the sub-activities that constitute an activity, in the past as well
  as in the future, multiple graph structures are possible. In this paper, we reason
  about these alternate possibilities by reasoning over multiple possible graph structures.
  We obtain them by approximating the graph with only additive features, which lends
  to efficient dynamic programming. Starting with this proposal graph structure, we
  then design moves to obtain several other likely graph structures. We then show
  that our approach improves the state-of-the-art significantly for detecting past
  activities as well as for anticipating future activities, on a dataset of 120 activity
  videos collected from four subjects.
