number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: 'The vanishing ideal of a set of n points S, is the set of all polynomials
  that attain the value of zero on all the points in S. Such ideals can be compactly
  represented using a small set of polynomials known as generators of the ideal. Here
  we describe and analyze an efficient procedure that constructs a set of generators
  of a vanishing ideal. Our procedure is numerically stable, and can be used to find
  approximately vanishing polynomials.  The resulting polynomials capture nonlinear
  structure in data, and can for example be used within supervised learning. Empirical
  comparison with kernel methods show that our method constructs more compact classifiers
  with comparable accuracy.  '
