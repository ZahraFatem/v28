title: Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis
abstract: 'We introduce Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), a method to learn
  complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting representations
  are highly linearly correlated. Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned
  to maximize the (regularized) total correlation.   It can be viewed as a nonlinear
  extension of the linear method \emphcanonical correlation analysis (CCA).  It is
  an alternative to the nonparametric method \emphkernel canonical correlation analysis
  (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does
  not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training
  time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when
  computing the representations of unseen instances.  In experiments on two real-world
  datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation
  than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid
  function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward
  neural networks.'
