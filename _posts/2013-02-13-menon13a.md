title: On the Statistical Consistency of Algorithms for Binary Classification under
  Class Imbalance
abstract: 'Class imbalance situations, where one class is rare compared to the other,
  arise frequently in machine learning applications. It is well known that the usual
  misclassification error is ill-suited for measuring performance in such settings.
  A wide range of performance measures have been proposed for this problem, in machine
  learning as well as in data mining, artificial intelligence, and various applied
  fields. However, despite the large number of studies on this problem, little is
  understood about the statistical consistency of the algorithms proposed with respect
  to the performance measures of interest. In this paper, we study consistency with
  respect to one such performance measure, namely the arithmetic mean of the true
  positive and true negative rates (AM), and establish that some simple methods that
  have been used in practice, such as applying an empirically determined threshold
  to a suitable class probability estimate or performing an empirically balanced form
  of risk minimization, are in fact consistent with respect to the AM (under mild
  conditions on the underlying distribution). Our results employ balanced losses that
  have been used recently in analyses of ranking problems (Kotlowski et al., 2011)
  and build on recent results on consistent surrogates for cost-sensitive losses (Scott,
  2012). Experimental results confirm our consistency theorems.  '
