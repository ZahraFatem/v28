title: A Generalized Kernel Approach to Structured Output Learning
number: '1'
section: cycle-1
abstract: We study the problem of structured output learning from a regression perspective.
  We first provide a general formulation of the kernel dependency estimation (KDE)
  approach to this problem using operator-valued kernels. Our formulation overcomes
  the two main limitations of the original KDE approach, namely the decoupling between
  outputs  in the image space and the inability to use a joint feature space. We then
  propose a covariance-based operator-valued kernel that allows us to take into account
  the structure of the kernel feature space. This kernel operates on the output space
  and only encodes the interactions between the outputs without any reference to the
  input space. To address this issue, we introduce a variant of our KDE method based
  on the conditional covariance operator that in addition to the correlation between
  the outputs takes into account the effects of the input variables. Finally, we evaluate
  the performance of our KDE approach using both covariance and conditional covariance
  kernels on three structured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the
  art kernel-based structured output regression methods.
