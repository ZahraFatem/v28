title: Label Partitioning For Sublinear Ranking
abstract: We consider the case of ranking a very large set of labels, items, or documents,
  which is common to information retrieval, recommendation, and large-scale annotation
  tasks. We present a general approach for converting an algorithm which has linear
  time in the size of the set to a sublinear one via label partitioning. Our method
  consists of learning an input partition and a label assignment  to each partition
  of the space such that precision at k is optimized, which is the loss function of
  interest in this setting. Experiments on large-scale ranking and recommendation
  tasks show that our method not only makes the original linear time algorithm computationally
  tractable, but can also improve its performance.
