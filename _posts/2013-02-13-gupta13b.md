title: Natural Image Bases to Represent Neuroimaging Data
abstract: 'Visual inspection of neuroimagery is susceptible to human eye limitations.  Computerized
  methods have been shown to be equally or more effective   than human clinicians
  in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless,   much of the work involves
  the use of domain expertise to extract hand-crafted features. The key technique
  in this paper is the use of cross-domain features to represent MRI data.  We used
  a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and   then applied
  convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
  (ADNI) dataset.Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three
  categories: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy
  Control (HC).Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classification
  performance,   which is competitive with or better than other approaches.'
