title: That was fast! Speeding up NN search of high dimensional distributions.
abstract: We present a data structure for fast nearest neighbor retrieval of generative
  models of documents based on KL divergence.  Our data structure, which shares some
  similarity with Bregman Ball Trees, consists of a hierarchical partition of a database,   and
  uses a novel branch and bound methodology for search.  The main technical contribution
  of the paper is a   novel and efficient algorithm  for deciding whether to explore
  nodes during backtracking, based on a variational approximation.  This reduces the
  number of computations per node, and overcomes the limitations of Bregman Ball Trees
  on high dimensional data.  In addition, our strategy is applicable also to probability
  distributions with hidden state variables, and is not limited to regular exponential
  family distributions.    Experiments demonstrate substantial speed-ups over both
  Bregman  Ball Trees and over brute force search, on both moderate and high dimensional
  histogram data.  In addition, experiments on linear dynamical systems demonstrate
  the flexibility of our approach to latent variable models.
