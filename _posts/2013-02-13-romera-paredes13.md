title: Multilinear Multitask Learning
abstract: Many real world datasets occur or can be arranged into multi-modal structures.  With
  such datasets, the tasks to be learnt can be referenced by multiple indices.  Current
  multitask learning frameworks are not designed to account for the preservation of
  this information.  We propose the use of multilinear algebra as a natural way to
  model such a set of related tasks. We present two learning methods;   one is an
  adapted convex relaxation method used in the context of tensor completion.  The
  second method is based on the Tucker decomposition and on alternating minimization.
  Experiments on synthetic and real data indicate that the multilinear approaches
  provide a significant  improvement over other multitask learning methods. Overall
  our second  approach yields the best performance in all datasets.
