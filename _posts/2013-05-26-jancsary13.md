title: Learning Convex QP Relaxations for Structured Prediction
abstract: We introduce a new large margin approach to discriminative training of intractable
  discrete graphical models. Our approach builds on a convex quadratic programming
  relaxation of the MAP inference problem. The model parameters are trained directly
  within this restricted class of energy functions so as to optimize the predictions
  on the training data. We address the issue of how to parameterize the resulting
  model and point out its relation to existing approaches. The primary motivation
  behind our use of the QP relaxation is its computational efficiency; yet, empirically,
  its predictive accuracy compares favorably to more expensive approaches. This makes
  it an appealing choice for many practical tasks.
