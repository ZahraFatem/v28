title: Efficient Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons
abstract: 'The ranking of n objects based on pairwise comparisons is a core machine
  learning problem, arising in recommender systems, ad placement, player ranking,
  biological applications and others. In many practical situations the true pairwise
  comparisons cannot be actively measured, but a subset of all n(n-1)/2 comparisons
  is passively and noisily observed. Optimization algorithms (e.g., the SVM) could
  be used to predict a ranking with fixed expected Kendall tau distance, while achieving
  an Ω(n) lower bound on the corresponding sample complexity. However, due to their
  centralized structure they are difficult to extend to online or distributed settings.
  In this paper we show that much simpler algorithms can match the same Ω(n) lower
  bound in expectation. Furthermore, if an average of O(n\log(n)) binary comparisons
  are measured, then one algorithm recovers the true ranking in a uniform sense, while
  the other predicts the ranking more accurately near the top than the bottom. We
  discuss extensions to online and distributed ranking, with benefits over traditional
  alternatives.  '
