title: 'Exploring the Mind: Integrating Questionnaires and fMRI'
abstract: A new model is developed for joint analysis of ordered, categorical, real
  and count data. The ordered and categorical data are answers to questionnaires,
  the (word) count data correspond to the text questions from the questionnaires,
  and the real data correspond to fMRI responses for each subject. The Bayesian model
  employs the von Mises distribution in a novel manner to infer sparse graphical models
  jointly across people, questions, fMRI stimuli and brain region, with this integrated
  within a new matrix factorization based on latent binary features. The model is
  compared with simpler alternatives on two real datasets. We also demonstrate the
  ability to predict the response of the brain to visual stimuli (as measured by fMRI),
  based on knowledge of how the associated person answered classical questionnaires.
