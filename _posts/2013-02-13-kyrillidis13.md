title: Sparse projections onto the simplex
abstract: Most learning methods with rank or sparsity constraints use convex relaxations,
  which lead to optimization with the nuclear norm or the \ell_1-norm. However, several
  important learning applications cannot benefit from this approach as they feature
  these convex norms as constraints in addition to the non-convex rank and sparsity
  constraints. In this setting, we derive efficient sparse projections onto the simplex
  and its extension, and illustrate how to use them to solve high-dimensional learning
  problems in quantum tomography, sparse density estimation and portfolio selection
  with non-convex constraints.
