title: Learning Sparse Penalties for Change-point Detection using Max Margin Interval
  Regression
abstract: In segmentation models, the number of change-points is typically    chosen
  using a penalized cost function.  In this work, we propose to    learn the penalty
  and its constants in databases of signals with    weak change-point annotations.
  We propose a convex relaxation for    the resulting interval regression problem,
  and solve it using    accelerated proximal gradient methods. We show that this method    achieves
  state-of-the-art change-point detection in a database of    annotated DNA copy number
  profiles from neuroblastoma tumors.
